# Beers of the World
This project was done in the Data visualization class at EPFL in the fall of 2017. The visualization allows the user to see local breweries in almost every country and get insights about the best beers they produce, according to user ratings and reviews. You will find an interactive map to select the beer you want to see information on. We created a chart of senses for each beer from the users reviews, as well as a similarity list and a beer type histogram for every country. For more information please read the project's process book.

## Dataset
We collected the data from [Ratebeer.com](http://ratebeer.com) in early November 2017.
