       "'The nitro really does disservice to the beer.  Lots of chocolate and expresso in the profile.  Decent stout aroma. Not what I expected at all.  For the money, its Guiness or Murphys Stout instead.I like it better than Guiness, but not as much as Murphys. Its a touch on the sweet side for me.Had it on nitro. When flat ti is like drinking swamp water. It has nearly zero flavor and a watery mouthfeel.This poured dark mahogany with a big vanilla ice cream head. Aroma is bearley there, slight roasty. The flavor is mellow. Sweet chocolate and burnt roasty barley duke it out with the chocolate slightly winning. The flavor is notably sweeter than Guinness. Finishes on the dry side, with a semi-bitter aftertaste. Mouthfeel is nice, as is the drinkability. A little smoother than Guinness.500ml widget can. Poured with the expected creamy nitro head. Black, almost opaque, ruby tints appear. Roasted malt and black coffee bitterness in the mouth. Lingering roasted finish. A good nitro can stout.500mL can. I dont see what the big fuss about this beer is and why its rated so high, perhaps the fact that it came in a can tainted the characteristics of it. Faint hoppy aroma, some metalic-ness to it...looks alright with its black body, but it just looks too fabricated and artificial with its clean white creamy head. tastes bitter, and thats about it.pours an amost opaque color, with a firm creamy head .... smell is somewhere between seabreeze and coalmine (which in itself seems quite a bandwith) .... the taste is dominated by licorice, spearmint and pomegranate ... with a bitter final note ... \\thasnt got the body of a Guinness, nor the dryness of a Murphys, but there is personality in this brew nonetheless ....This beer is always compared to Guinness, they are very similar.  Both commercial stout beers, both are excellent.   Dark creamy head, little as far as aroma, maybe slight coffee smell, malt flavor, decent hops taste and bitter finish.Basic stout taste, nothing too special. Appearance is awesome, would buy again but not first choice.Quite fluid in the pour, a very nice offering with a great appearance.  NIce thick creamy head, and a beautiful brown pour.  Goes down nice and smooth and it is gone and you are left wondering where it went.  A very solid stout.by far one of my favorite stouts to flood my area.  very creamy head...smooth taste and not as filling as other stouts.  always my top choiceI must first say two things, one - this is not really my type of beer, two - I tried this after a heavier scottish ale. With that in mind I found this to be quite bland and watery. It looked very nice, and had a perfect creamy head. There was an obvious sweet/stouty aroma. As the glass warmed I noticed a bit of a nutty taste but nothing substantial. As for a verdict, the jury is still out, I want to try it again, but against some of its closer competitors. (Guiness for one)Nitro can into a glass. Pitch baclk pour with all the traits. Excellent smooth balanced taste with a small bitterness. Not as much chocolate which is fine. Some coffee. Very bice!A very enjoyable stout. Taste better than guiness.  Nice foamy head goes down real nice.Sampled at the brewery. Lighter and dryer than Guinness, but with an outspoken hopbitternessOn tap in Dublin. A greate stout, nice creamy and white head. Very nutty, nice chocolate aroma. I even prefer it compare to a guiness. Best stout I have tried until this time.A very good stout ! -- Guinness, watch out: Beamish is on its way to catch you !Thin, watery, smokey. Tje can seemed to lend a note of tin. Remarkably bland. Aleast it is dry and bitter. I had this at caberetonmain(.com) in Stoughton WI where the waiter sing and did funny blue cole porter numbers so at least I saw a great show.UPDATED: DEC 20, 2005 I liked this one.  Its inevitable that Guiness is going to be the basis of comparisons for all stouts - especially ones from the motherland - but this one fared well.  Rich, coffee, chocolate like flavor.  Full and flavorful and slightly bitter.  This is a textbook example of a lighter fairing dry stout.UPDATED: AUG 26, 2007 I am not a big fan of dry stouts. Sampled from a 16 oz widget can this beer poured a black color with a huge soapy khaki head that lingers. The aroma is dry bitterness with a light floral hops. The mouthfeel is creamy and moderately thick as one would expect from a widget. The flavor is bitter roasted malt with a hint of coffee.Can. Black pour, creamy head. Roasted malt nose, smooth creamy mouthfeel, dry roasted taste but not a lot of depth to the taste.UPDATED: MAR 18, 2008 A decent stout in its own right, fairly creamy and pretty tasty. If you like nitro can stouts, give it a try. If you dont, this wont convert you.UPDATED: MAY 14, 2007 I love watching nitrous beers settle. Its a thing of beauty. Aroma is muted but I get a touch of roastiness. Deep black with a massive (two fingers thick) head that floats atop the body. Roasted malt flavors with some smokiness, but not much else flavor wise. Very quaffable at first, but it is so light on flavor it gets monotonous very fast.(can) Nice and creamy, though that could have been because of the widget. Compared to Guinness, a little sweeter, with a a subtle chocolate flavor instead of coffee. I liked it, and would probably like it more if I can ever find it on tap.In honor of the soon to be departed Beamish, I thought Id crack one open while my buddy and I were visiting. I had a little trouble popping the top open as the opening actually came off the can. With a little determination, the can was opened and not a drop misplaced. The pour did not have the cascade effect that I thought it might, but what was just as impressive was the color and aroma of this beer. Midnight black and an aroma of coffee, bitter chocolate, toffee and some slight smoke made my mouth water. A nice off-white head capped this puppy and it was ready to consume. Flavors were much like the aroma, but I have to admit that it felt rather thin in my mouth which was the only dent in the armor. This one went really quickly, which is always a great sign. I really hate seeing this beer vanishing from my stores, but I hope it returns one day so the beer geeks of tomorrow will be able to taste this fine beverage (assuming its made the same way). Lastly, I would drink this stuff over the Guiness stout anytime.On Tap.  Black color with thick creamy tan head.  Aroma is lightly smokey.  Flavor is smooth much like Guiness but has more of a smokey malt flavor.  Not my favorite, but I like it a lot as a pub beer.On tap. Pours black with a creamy light tan head. Aroma is the typical roasted malt, not overly grainy or astringent. Some chocolate and black coffee are also present over the light hops that give it a sharpness. Flavor is very nice, smooth and rich. Lots of roasted malt, a nice bit of smokiness and a bit helping of peat and barley. Lots of chocolate and black malt help balance with the light hops that add some bitterness but very smooth and milky through the finish. Medium, but a bit light creamy body and a soft carbonation. I definitely like it more than Guinness, it has more complexity but is easy drinking, and I really dig the earthiness of the smoke and peat.Another gutless Irish stout.  These guys need a lesson from Rogue.Black beer, creamy head. A bit too thin and metallic. End is very pleasant. Velvety texture. A nice well-balanced brew.On nitro tap at Green Dragon in Portland, OR--Poured a deep dark somewhat brown body with a thick creamy whitish head.  Silky malty, mildly smoky.  Mouthfeel was creamy and chalky.  Quite nice.  Hints of bourbon, woodsmoked peat, malt, and a slight hops tang.  Very drinkable earnest brew.Draught, small creamy head, dark brown colour with some lighter streaks, aroma of coffee with metalic notes. Roasted coffee continues in the flavour with some bitterness and some sweetness in the back, medium bodied and just a little bit watery. Overall a pleasant stout which is not to dry.From what I understand there are three big names in traditional Irish dry stouts: Guinness, Murphys and Beamish. While the first two are indeed dry and fairly bitter, Beamish is quite sweet and smooth in comparison. Why isnt this Irelands flagship beer?\\t\\tPOUR, COLOR AND AROMA\\t\\tBeamish comes in 14.9oz cans with a nitrogen widget so it pours a little rough (they should widen the mouth on the can). It then forms a nearly opaque brown body with a creamy dark tan head which lasts longer than the beer itself does (and is quite tasty, too). The aroma is standard for a stout of this type with a mild, malty scent. No distinct ingredients were noticeable.\\t\\tTASTE\\t\\tPeople who criticize Guinness and/or Murphys for their perceived dry, bitter flavor would do well to try Beamish. As soon as this beer hit my palate a noticeable sweet flavor was evident, followed by a thin, watery composition.\\t\\tWhile I prefer my stouts to be the 3 Rs (rich, robust and roasty), Beamish was still pleasing with a palate that is much less dry than traditional Irish stouts of the sort. A subtle almond-like flavor was detected, as was a hint of roastiness, but there was also a distinct sweet creaminess to the flavor. The only caveat to Beamish (aside from its overall mild palate) is its dry aftertaste, which I found surprising considering its ultra-smooth finish and thin body.\\t\\tFINISH\\t\\tTo call Beamish smooth is an understatement. This might be one of the easiest-to-drink stouts on the planet. This isnt surprising considering its body and creamy characteristics.\\t\\tBODY\\t\\tAt only 4.1% ABV, this stout is lighter than most light lagers, but obviously much more appealing. I wasnt able to get a confirmation on the calories and carbs, but I can tell this is a very light-bodied beer. Stouts of this type lend themselves to sessions, and Beamish would make a perfect choice for such.\\t\\tFINAL THOUGHTS\\t\\tAlthough I wouldve preferred a more intense beer, Beamish Irish Stout is still a delectable, appealing, easy-to-drink brew that could very likely be enjoyed by anyone.\\t\\tNOTE: watch the video version of this review at:\\t\\thttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lcF1U44ff7MAh, black death awaits.  Head lasts to the end, very creamy.  Malty flavor throughout.  More watery than Guinness, but still a suitable stout.This nitro version pours milky chocolate colored w/ a one finger creamy froth that sits there the whole drink. The color turns midnight brown ofter the dust settles. Aromas are mild w/ some sweet, roasted malts. Medium full nectar w/ very little residual effers. It does have a somewhat creamy texture though. Theres a nice mild malty sweetness balanced by a defiened roast component. Flavors of roasted coffee bean, bitter leather, and herbs. The finish is bittered perfectly and leaves my palate semi parched ready for my next sip.Pours a beautiful dark brown with a very creamy frothy head.  Malty flavor with a hint of hops on the aftertaste.  Not a bad stout but not one of my favorites.p boks fra systembolaget - en fyldig og god stout p boks :-)from the widget can:\\tvery little aroma; if anything, roasted malt on the nose.  glorious beige head that lasts and sticks on the inside of the glass.  tastes like a milder version of guinness, not nearly as dry or bold as guinness.  overall pretty good; it would make a nice session beer.Pours with a big nitrogen head and a deep mahogany color leaves some good lacing. Pretty mild aroma with nothing funky. Flavor is nice chocolate and coffee, but not overpowering. Body is very thin which is my main complaint with this beer. Overall it is pretty good and I could drink a few of these at a time.Not as bitter as I expected, but still very strong. Quite even for a stout. Excellent, but a bit too pricey in the U.S.. Good thing I drank a few gallons in Ireland where its cheap.UPDATED: OCT 13, 2005 Similar to Guinness. Gotta love that creamy mouthfeel. Dominated by coffee and roast, with minimal chocolate. I like the ntro thing in Irish stouts, but not much else.A nice, smooth Irish stout. From the nitrogen can, pours smooth and creamy with a strong tan head.  Not as much snap as Guiness. I would compare it with Murphy\\'s. Very nice and full, not too bitter or heavy.Tap and can - both venues hold equal ratings. Aroma - coffee, Apearance was not as impressive as some of its competitors. Flavor -  medium bitterness (less charcoal than competitors) , Palate - full body. Favorite of all commercial stouts and an all around great beer.Almost black coloured beer with an average off white head. Malty roasted aroma. Full creamy palate. Finish is rather bitter, roasted. Medium stout.poured black with light tan head. aroma roasted malts, caramel, toffee, sourness. flavor dry roasted nuts, caramel, watery, it did have more flavor than guinness16 oz can w/ widget:  Lasting creamy light beige head on a dark brown almost opaque body.  Lightly roasted coffee aroma at first, but strenghthens as it warms. Subtle aromas of toasty malt and hints of chocolate and nutty grains.  Smooth roasty coffee flavor is mild but assertive compared to other flavors.  Some nutty flavors, but toasty flavor is missing from the aroma.  A bit of sourness from dark grains, but its less than tart.  Smooth creamy m/f, low carb, lighter medium body.  Easy drinking, but I think less flavorful than the other 2 main stream dry stouts.Pours a pitch black with a 1/4 inch, creamy, light brown head. Very lacy. Smell is lightly creamy with hints of coffe and bitter chocolate.\\t\\tTaste is quite nutty. What follows is creamy coffee and light bitter chocolate. Smoky and bitter. Did I mention the bitterness? So from hops, some from roasted barley. A milky subdued bitterness. Very creamy and smooth mouth. Very drinkable beer and probably the most flavorful of the Holy Trinity of Irish Dry Stouts.Has a dark black color and a great head, abundant and frothy. The aroma is unmistakable, of black chocolate. The flavor is with the brown chocolate, but the finish is dry and a bit bitter, maybe too much. But, is a excellent stout.I really love this stuff, close to guinness but not quite the perfect pint,,,great head wonderful smooth taste and after taste will leave u wanting moreWhy do so many people drink Guinness?  Probably because they dont know that Beamish exists...  I can t understand the love affair that people have with Guinness ( a super-light bodied beer with little calories, minimal alcohol, and a very bland).  Beamish IS Irish stout... A true stout, with great depth, good balance, and no hocus-pocus on the \"brewmasters\" end  (most people dont realize that Guinness is actually plain dark ale and a bacterially-infected pale ale that is blended together just before bottling/kegging).  If you want a stout that is historically accurate and true to style, Beamish wins top spot, hands down.canned (4,2% ABV). A black beer with a nice creamy nitrogen brown head, that lasts for a long time. The aroma is a little weak and light. However there are some coffee notes. Surely better is the flavour that is roasty with hints of coffee and chocolate. dry with enough bitterness. I would have preferred a stronger stout, but the light body gives it a great drinkability. A nice Irish stout.Rated: 29 November 2006\\tOn tap in pub. \\tCreamy thick nitro head, beautiful black body, taste of noble ash, coffee and good clean mineral calcium water, the impession of nice home made ham, one of my best Dry Stout or even among Stouts in general.Dark brown with white creamy head.  Chocolate roasty aroma.  Watery light bodied palate.  Vaguely roasty chocolate taste with a disappointing finish.UPDATED: AUG 27, 2005 Can.  Black with a creamy head.  Aroma of coffee.  Flavor of coffee and bitter chocolate.  Thick and filling.  Left a dry taste in my mouth.  Full bodied, but not as filling as Guinness.  Very enjoyable.Purchased at Archer Liquors in Chicago, IL; enjoyed prior to watching Monday Night Football.  Appearance is like an advertisement, pure black with a rich, frothy off white / tan head.  Aroma a bit milky with chocolate notes, also a hint of coffee and roasted malt.  Taste a bit more smokey than Guinness, just as rich and creamy.  Id say a little more flavor as well, more chocolate and coffee.  Rather enjoyable.Pours black with a thick and creamy biege head. Mild roasted coffee aroma. Thin mouthfeel. Sweet and malty. Watery finish. I sampled this out of a can, so I am handicapping this beer.  It\\'s good and very drinkable. It has a beautiful head. I think I could use a fork on it.Wow, I was impressed.  The aroma was not as nice as Guinness, and I somewhat expect the bittnerness of it, but for those who dont like the Guinness sour tones, youll love this.Said it before I do like and rather enjoy the nitro cans - also have had on tap.  Good stuff.  Smooth & rich enough.  Not being from across the pond unless I have em side by side very similar to Guiness to me.On Tap: Some hops and roast in the nose. Very dry creamy texture. Some apple and bitter toast in the after taste. Overall not bad, not much different than Guinness other than the apple.A sight of beauty...  Better then Guiness and better then Murphys.  Very smooth, coffee notes, it is slightly watery, but for us newcomers who can hang tough for the Arrogant Bastards of the world this is the way to go.The can looks good, the beer in the glass incredible - how can a beer look better? Fine aroma like coffee and chocolate. Tastes modest malty, fine finish. Really good beer.Black color, roasted coffee aroma and taste, medium body, light watery finish.very little aroma mabe burnt coffee, apperance beautiful black,flavour lacks not much there palate is thin and had very unflavourful bitter finnishA good alternative to Guinness, with more flavor and less palate.Colore nero,schiuma cremosa e persistente,aroma di malto tostato,gusto corposo,morbido,di malto.Perfetta se bevuta come ho fatto io direttamente nel paese dorigine,accompagnamento perfetto di un buon piatto di frutti di mare.UPDATED: MAR 1, 2004 Likely a final re-rate, finally comfortable with my assessment of this subtle and mostly unremarkable dry stout, nitro\\'d from a draught can, sampled slowly starting at 50 deg F from a nonic style pint glass.<P>\\tPours near opaque dark brown with expected inch of beige heavy foam, rising cascade of tiny bubbles.  Eventually settles into near black liquid with a well defined beige layer above.  Aroma is mild but enticing, appetizing, even refreshing, with light roast, light chocolate, light caramel, perhaps a twinge of woody or herbal hops.  Palate is creamy, thin and light, like velvety water.  Dominant initial flavor is deeply and unmistakeably smoky, which gives way to a soft, dry finish.  Lingering smoke and caramel.  After a time, my palate adapted to the smokiness, leaving very little in the remaining flavor...barest hint of chocolate, perhaps weak, cold coffee.Deep, deep ochre-black with a slab of solid creamy tan head. Once settled, this head held ground at about one inch thick. Fragrant bouquet of olives, wine grapes, hops and strawberry fields. Peculiar taste for a stout, meant in the best way possible. No coffee flavor whatsoever. Did hit on dark chocolate, dark roasted malts, with the addition of smoke midway through the pint. Possibly one of the best irish stouts Ive ever had.I think this beer is overrated.  It is nice and dry and has a bit of bitterness that Guinness lacks, but aside from that, tis quite boring.creamy, creamy, and creamy. very good stout for the casual stout fan. much better on tap than can. nothing bitter about it, finishes nice and easy, very nice stoutThis is the worst beer Ive ever tasted;  I drank about 1/3 and had to put the rest down the drain; Ive never done that before.Can not belive I had not entered this one. I had quite a ffew last night, right up against Guiness, and I feel it falls right there. Good, available most places if the other is not. A standard, not The head of the class.Now this is a fine dark brew. Perhaps top 5 of them. It just about beats guiness but a centimeetre. An amazing enjoyment and a different experience. Though there is something pretty oily in its flavour and if you have to many of theere, it will slide out as easilly as it slides in. This is a must taste brew, but keep off drinking more than 6 of them. That you wouldnt find in a Guiness.Nice creamy pour, nice roasted nose, aromatic for a nitro can.  Considerable structure in the palate, watery mouthfeel. I like it.As another says, an underrated beer in Ireland where the Guinness juggernaut has embedded a huge conservatism in the attitudes of most drinkers). Nice weight and pleasantly dry, and if found in a pub with a good flow, it can be almost unbeatable. Deserving of great respect.this shit is better than guinness stout and worse than murphys stout.  a good beer, typical of a pasturized stout, if you have had one you have had them all.UPDATED: MAY 8, 2004 Re-rate: Roasted malt fresh. Some subtle chocolate notes. Cascading body when opened, just like Guiness. Large off-white head. Fully retaining. Dry flavor like Guiness. Very smooth and easy drinking. Has some bready notes, subtle. Wouldn\\'t want to drink more than one in a sitting, however. Aroma 8; Appearance 5; Flavor 6; Palate 5; Overall 13. Original Rating:I agree with jeffwhalen and Verne: Beamish is better than Guiness. Very similar but Beamish is slightly sweeter and therefore more interesting.I was expecting something better from this one on tap...I felt like I was cheating myself, drinking something that looked so dark and rich but really wasnt. At least Guinness has the name.Looks and smells like a stout, but I found it to be thin in the body and taste areas.  A typical Irish stout.I really love a good pint of stout, and I have found a wonderful one with Beamish.  I thought Murphys and Guiness were good but this a very good stout.  A bit dryer than Guiness but very good.  It has a nice mellow creaminess to it!  I will drink it again!Draught. Pours on settling into a reassuring stoutish black body with off-white head. Roasted malt on the nose, and coarser on the palate than Guinness, with a slightly rounder and more bitter taste. Decent stout.Beamish is better than Guinness, but not as good as Murphys.  I would drink it any chance I get since all three are good beers.I cant fathom why experienced raters are giving this upwards of 3.6.  Nitro can:  Extremely thin, more so even than Guinness.  Little aroma.  Nice bitterness, roasty, coffee.  Meh.Weak nose, nice creamy head, nice combination of coffee and bitter, however just a little too much bitter for me.  I would have to go for Beamish Stout over Guinness.Smoother than Guinness but not bad by all means. A very well crafted stout.Many thanks to IDRM for bringing the can from Ireland!\\tAppearance: Very dark brown with lots of creamy, tan head.\\tAroma: Dark malt, roasted, tar.\\tTaste: More dark malt and roasted. Slight smoke and bitterness.\\tInfo: 500ml can, 24/10-2011Feb. 2006 - Thanks to eaglefan538 for donating one of his four-pack to me. I had this and a Murphys Stout back to back, splitting them both with my father. The appearance was phenomenal as was the roasty, yet sweet aroma. The flavor was predominantly roasty with some sweet choco/cocoa going through. The mouthfeel was REALLY smooth...yet I cant help but feel that the nitro cans cheat a little. The flavor is definitely not very strong when the nitro takes over. Overall, sweeter and smoother than the Murphys, but less overall strength of flavor.This one has an excellent creaminess to it that gives it a smooth feeling on the palate.  Pleasant enough taste; nothing offensive certainly, and what youd expect from an Irish stout.Widget can.  I really enjoyed this stout.  The widget, for once, did not cover up all of the flavors.  I believe that I liked this one better than Guinness or Murphy\\'s.  This should be in the dictionary next to the word stout.I had the opportunity to travel Ireland for ten days with a couple buddies.  And we began out tour downing plenty of Guinness.  When we reached Cork we got our hands on some Beamish.  We never looked back.  Wherever we could get the stuff (which even in its home country is suprisingly limited) we drank it.  I find myself craving it regularly, with its thirst quenching quality and malted goodness.  I only wish that it was readily available.These cans with the nitrous canister in them produce the most beautiful creamy off-white head you ever want to see. The beer itself is deep garnet in color and crystal clear. The aroma is delicate with slight notes of roast malt and chocolate. The body was medium-light with low carbonation. The texture is watery. The taste starts with roasted malt and notes of chocolate in the background. The middle begins to get dry and clean with a long lasting smoky finish.14.9 oz widget can. As with most of these gimmick cans, it makes for a pretty glass of beer - dark brown with a tight, creamy tan head. Roasty, burnt malt nose, hints of coffee. Ooofff... not so good flavor, like charcoal with a bit of lighter fluid, burnt and smoky. Body is the light side of medium, a bit too thin. Meh.Not really fair to rate from a can.\\tSurprisingly thin and watery to be a really dark stout. A hint of tar and smoke.UPDATED: MAY 1, 2007 I love this stuff! It pours with an amazing cascade before turning a dark brownish with a frothy head. This tastes better than it looks, with a chocolately toffee hint and very smooth finish. Id inject it into my veins if I could :)Canned - 500ml. Pours a solid dark brown body with a perfect off-white creamy head. Pleasant roasted coffee nose with notes of chocolate and wood. Flavors of roasted malt, coffee, nuts and hops. Nice long and bitter final. Very close to Guiness...draft. THis beer has a very craamy mouthfeel and the flavor is mildly roasty. not too bad5.2%, 500 ml. can, served in a 440 ml. tumbler.\\t\\tDark brown, almost black with a poor head which soon dissipates.\\t\\tTastes sour, almost soapy but not nauseatingly so.\\t\\tSkirts a fine line between being slightly smooth and watery.\\t\\tNot worth NZ$4.35/can although Id drink it again if it were free. \\t\\tIve hardly had any Irish beers before but Im sure that there are many which are much, much better than this.Dark reddish black with a thick capuccino nitro head. Nice nose of cold coffee and wet wood.  Powdery cocoa with smoked peat notes,  a little nutty, and light hoppy finale. Rather thin, but still good. Can from LCBO.  1 cup went to make Arroz con Pollo y cilantro.Had this on vacation, now I\\'m ticked I can\\'t get it at home.  Similar to Guinness, but a lil better in my opinion.flogging molly was down and i cant blame um, this is good stuff!!Mahogany brown in color, Beamish features a beautiful two-finger thick, frothy light-beige head, pleasant but slippery lace. \\t\\tI note a chaulky aroma mixed in with the chocolate and black patent malts. Theres also a smell that reminds me of paper paste. I cannot detect any hops, but the malt aroma are very powerful \\t\\tVery dark coffee flavors immediately hit the taste buds. The hop is the second note, but it is very subtle (as expected). This has a creamy quality both in consistancy and in flavor. \\t\\tThis stout is more \"harsh\" than the other famous stouts, as if the Beamish recipe had doubled the black patent portion. My personal preference leans more to the creamier and slightly less bitter.Probably the best stout Ive had to date. Amazing mouth feel, perfect balance of hops chocolate undertones and coffee. Ive yet to find it in the states, and Im getting desperateNitro can. Pours in typical nitro fashion with a thick deep dark brown body and dense tan head. Aroma is only subtle, roasted malts, caramelly and a bit nutty. A big coffee flavour is what gets my attention more than anything. Hints of sweet toffee flavours. Not really an overly complex stout, but smooth. Dry sort of finish, tiny hint of metallic bitterness I seem to pick up with these nitro beers. A welcome change from a draught Guiness I must sayCan - Always fun to watch an Irish stout settle.  Lingering head, almost aroma free.  Mild, smooth, very easy drinking.  Nice lingering mild burnt coffee flavour on back of tongue.  A darn good stout.Black pour with a creamy beige head.  All the flavor of a Guinness Draught.  Very smooth beer.  A bit weak on the backside for a stout.  Chocolaty aroma, malty.  Solid beer.UPDATED: JAN 21, 2006 Smoother than Guinness, very drinkable. A stout recommended for beginners. Rerate: ...which doesnt in any way imply that Beamish hasnt a lot to offer the experienced stout drinker as well. Aroma is better than Guinness, and the flavour is very nice too. I simply suggested that the prejudiced anti-stout drinker might find out that he/she actually likes it.Beautiful dark pour, massive head, with heavy lace. Crazy \"Guinness Style\" bubbles, with widget. Sweet, grainy aroma. Zero carbonation, soy sauce and worcestershire flavor dominates, with nutty alcoholic notes. Thick mouth that thins as it goes down. I liked this more than Guinness.UPDATED: JUN 24, 2005 Easy to drink and very dense and smooth. Awesome coffee flavor, its a dessert in a can, complete with whipped cream headIts nearly Guinness, but sweater. Easier to drink and cheaper! A good, full stout that slips down nicely. Give it a try instead of Mr GAn ok middle of the road stout just doesnt do as well as the guinnVery dark beer with a creamy head.  Not as thick as a Guinness, but very flavorful.  Also, a bar in Spain used to serve Beamish and Grimbergen Double mixtos.  Very good!Despite its decent aroma, its metallic aftertaste, gossamer body and fleeting nitro foam dont make for a substantial experience.Draught nitrokeg.  A black beer with a big creamy white head.  There is little to the aroma and a slight roastiness tothe taste.  Otherwise a watery mass produced challenger to Guinness but neither of them are winners.Nice aroma, sweet coffee, sweeter then Guinness.  Absolutely SEXY head on it.  3/4 inch of fine cream colored foam.  Semisweet taste at first that finishes with a very pleasant roasted taste and dry mouthfeel.  I LOVE IT!  This is my first one ever, i have always been a Guinness guy but this has a hoppy character that is a nice change..  I dont know that i could drink it all night....... but i will certianly give it the old Delta Sig try!  I would love to try this on tap!Beautiful nutty nose.  Pours dark as night with a great head.  Very nice smooth taste without that horrible Guinness after taste.  Beats the living daylights out of Guinness or Boddington.basically the same as Guinness widgetized and Murpys widgetized... in other words, a flat light tasting stout that doesnt cut it when compared to a truly great un-widgeted stoutTypical character of dry Irish stout, relatiavely light body, coffee roasted malt flavors, slightly sweet aftertaste.  A decent light Irish stout but no earthshaker.500 ml can. 4.3%. From Tallinn, Estonia.\\tBlack colour with tan creamy head.\\tAroma is chocolate, coffee and roasted malt. Flavour is some chocolate/toffee sweetness, coffee, roasted malt and dry bitterness. Smooth and nice.UPDATED: OCT 9, 2006 On Tap, Bites and Brews, Pgh, PA.\\t\\tPours very dark, with Big, White, creamy head. Faint aroma of chocolate. Taste is of maltiness and chocolate, and molasses. It was sweet toward the middle and dry through the finish. Texture is watery. It was good though, and not as heavy as guinness.On tap at lbaren. Pours a dark brown almost black with a creamy head. Aromas of espresso and dark chocolate. Flavours of roasted malts, espresso, and dark bitter chocolate.I like Beamish better than Guiness.  Very heady.Poured from a can with a Nitrogen widget inside of it. First off, I despise beer that is poured on nitrogen and I have a feeling that I will equally despise a beer from a Nitrogen can. A hell of a pour, black with an incredibly dense and creamy light mocha head. The aroma is lightly nutty with ints of coffee and chocolate but overall the aroma is extremely faint. The flavor is much like the aroma, lightly nutty, light coffee and chocolate. Creamy texture but still not full bodied. Hell the nitrogen works in this case. This is a very quaffable and pleasing beverage. I am quite surprised at how much I am enjoying this one. Since finding RateBeer I have not spent a lot of time with this style and especially not ones from a can with a Nitrogen widget, but maybe this is a mistake. Certainly it is not a complex beer, but nonetheless it is an enjoyable beer and isnt that what this is all supposed to be about?Nitro can. Pours dark brown, nearly black, with a large frothy brown head. Aroma of roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee. Flavors of roasted, nutty malts, chocolate, coffee... kinda thinish in the mouth, but definitely drinkable.Nitro Can.  Pours a big black stout with a thin off white head. Nice cascade effect.  Aroma is toffee, chocolate, and sweet coffee with a nice bitter dry finish.  qulity can.Brown pour, nitro head.  Roasted malts, light chocolate and coffee.  Creamy, but light mouthfeel.  Very similar to guiness.  Mediocre dry stout.This was neat looking when I poured it , good for an Irish Stout. A bit sour in my opinion. I got it in the can watch out when you open it... sprayed all over the counter topGood theatrical pour, as the bubbles go downward first, and come up to produce a decent head.  Aroma is slightly noticable, and isnt terribly impressive.  Flavor is creamy, and very smooth.  Nothing too fancy, but very drinkable, would be most exelent with a strong chocolatey flavor.This stout was very tasty.  I found it at Trader Joes in Cambridge, MA for $7/4 cans.  I bet it is much better on tap.Beamish Irish stout is pitch black with a thick, dense, creamy tan head that has excellent retention and lacing.  It has a slightly sweet, malty aroma; a grainy smell with a metallic note, all muffled by the head.  It is medium-light bodied, very smooth and almost flat with a pretty clean finish.  It has a mellow, smooth flavor with a metallic note.  Theres a decent bitterness and it tastes almost savory.  Its quite drinkable.  This was in a blind tasting with Murphys and Guinness.  It ranked second.  Apparrently, they no longer make this and I cant review it on BeerAdvocate.A great black color with a quarter inch thick head. The aroma is sweet and malty with a lot of roasted scents. The roasted malt offers a great taste with a tiny amount of bitterness.(440mL Can): Frothy, aggrivated liquid. Forms a good-sized head after a while, creamy yellow, very lasting. Very dark brown blackish body, impossible to see through. Malty creamy aroma, earthy, dark coffee grounds. But not very strong aroma, even after warming up for a little bit. Watery taste, some coffee, chocolate. A little bitter.Tap->honker: Pours a large, creamy, off-white head that exhibits excellent lacing atop a black body.  Aroma is of caramel, flowers, and light yeast.  The body is light, texture thin, and the flavors duration is average, moderately sweet, and lightly bitter.  The foam seems to mask the aroma--not a horrible beer, but doesnt stand out othern the fact that its unique to find on tap in the US.I prefer this to Guinness because it is smoother. However, at the same time, it is thin and watery. The coffee and chocolate flavors are subtle and seem to get lost when drinking. Still a fairly good stout.Can: Poured a dark black with a creamy huge light brown head. Aroma is sweet malts and caramel. Taste is sweet coffee bean, roasted malts, and just enough of a tange to keep it inviting. Leaves a sweet taste on the tongue.Nice stout qualities.  A fine beer, but there are better out there.Better than most stouts due to a creamier body and less harsh of a coffee/chocolate flavor. Good stout.Draught, black with the typical foamy brown head. A roasted and caramal malt aroma, nothing special. Quite watery with non-dememo  malt flavours. Quite smooth though and nto offensive.Comparably \"light\" bodied stout with heavy dark roasted coffee flavor.  Just not much else to say about it.UPDATED: JAN 14, 2010 Same lovely garnet black as the other big Irish stouts. Foamy head like any other nitro-can. Roasty aroma with a hint of alcohol, strangely since this is only 4.1% ABV. Taste is lighter than others of this style and somewhat smokey.Its OK, I am sure it is better  on tap than from a can.  If you like Belhaven, Boddingtons, and Guinness in the nitro cans, you will like this.  Very easy drinking.Syrupy brown color with 1/2\" head that lightened but sustained. Nice lacing. Fruity, bready nose. Light entry with full malty mouth and a mildly bitter, toasty &#40;or is it roasty&#41;, dark chocolate aftertaste. Drank it with a Thanksgiving turkey and sausage gumbo - jealous?Pretty standard Irish stout, pours beautifully out of nitro-widget-can, smooth nitrogenated Irish stout taste, roasty malt bitterness in the finish, standard all the way.UPDATED: JUL 13, 2006 Simply amazing and no longer available in Canada and many other regions of North America! I dont know what Fosters (the multi-national that holds the rights to Beamish) is thinking, but in my opinion, this is the best stout you can get. It pours from the can with an amazing cascade beforing turning a dark blackish brown with a frothy head. The flavour is amazing with hints of chocolate and oatmeal. It goes down the gullet with silky smooth efficiency. I personally went through hell trying to find this stout in our area and finally made a road trip to Michigan to buy two of the last cases anywhere remotely close to us. If you live in Ireland, please send me some Beamish ASAP!My second favorite stout behind Guinness.Can.  Pours a super dark, brown/black body with red hues when held to the light.  Clear with an average, super creamy,beige head.  Slight roast and chocolate on the nose with the roast continuing in the flavors.  Light ash accompanied by coffee and hints of dark chocolate.  Light-medium body with a dry mildly ashen, toasty and bitter roast finish.  Very nice.Aroma is more than I expected: nice roastiness and slightly sweet. Appearance is striking: dark brown with garnet tones throughout, and it is clear!  The light mocha head looks terrific against the dark body. Flavor features an even light balance of roastiness offset by light hops and that slight tang. Carbonation is very light, which helps the superb smoothness of this brew. Body is a tad thin, although the overall light theme doesnt suffer much from this. Finish is similarly balanced and slightly dry. Overall this is one of the best demonstrations of this style acting as thirst-quenching refreshment. To my taste it is a little light in flavor and body, but it is extremely well-balanced and will please those who prize a lighter touch in their stouts.Very good dry stout.  Great head, little to no carbonation.  Aroma is very malty, and the taste is earthy.  Lighter than I expected it to be.  I really enjoyed Beamish...not a Guinness, but Il take it.UPDATED: NOV 1, 2008 scura schiuma fine note di caramello tostato e toffee caffe cioccolato meno amara e secca del solitowidgetted can 3/17/05. Full bodied, tan medium head. dark black color. Almost identical to guinness except guinness has a little more flavor which makes it better. Good irish stout.Widget can:  Too creamy, too artificial in appearance (but pretty), this has a nice roasted barley aroma, a bit of toastiness to it.  Very smooth to drink, of course.  A bit watery.  Light sweetness with solid roasted tastes and a very dry finish.  Not bad, but I think its been overrated.Draft in France. Blackish with hints of red and a white head. Roast and chocolate nose. A bit thin on the tongue but nice roasty chocolate flavors. Finishes very dry.Draft. Roasted mocca aroma. Black with sloiky light-brown head. Taste... not much. Smoke, roast, vegetables. Sliky and smooth.This is less lactic than a Guiness. From the tap in Ireland this is an excellent drop, quite superior to the canned variety. There is a good hit of chocolate, coffee and black malt here which is softened by the hop balance. Good mouthfeel and excellent contract on the pour.440 ml can with nitro widget. Opaque with red highlights and a 2-finger creamy head that lasts forever. Aroma of coffee with cream and sugar, roasted nuts, and slight char. Flavor is filled with the same stuff, plus hickory smoke and caramel apple. Medium body is watery and velvety-smooth, with no carbonation and a slightly dry-chalky finish. Very good session stout.Pretty thin beer. I prefer Guinness and murphys. Probably will not buy this one again.Serving: 440 ml. can from Total Wine Sterling. \\tAroma: The nose has light roasted notes, a bit of husk, and some cooked vegetables. \\tAppearance: It pours a very, very dark brown with lots of ruby highlights and a dense, creamy, light tan head.  Thanks nitrogen widget! \\tTaste: Mmmm... cooked veg, some stale roasted malt, an off green bitterness, and burnt notes.  This is dreadful. \\tPalate: Thin and limp on the palate with no carbonation (thanks nitrogen widget!) and a nasty bitter finish. \\tOverall: This can o crap is pretty bad.  I managed two sips before I poured the rest down the drain.  Anyone who prefers this to Guinness has no tastebuds. \\tScore: 4.3.2.1.5Creamy and mild with a smoky flavor.  That nitro capsule sure does the trick!  It creates one helluva head every time.  Good.draught...can. Pours incredibly dark. Nice head, a very faint but noticeable flavor of chox & coff and malts.  A bit sweeter than the guiness/archetype, but really good nonetheless.UPDATED: JUN 22, 2007 From tap: well its quite thin and watery, the flavor itself is quite weak of cocca and coffee, also a bit sweet for a stout, not a bad one, just ok.UPDATED: APR 5, 2003 I always liked this beer but am re-rating this because I don\\'t think it deserves a 4.8. Very similar to Guinness or Murphy\\'s but maybe the most bitter of the three.Courtesy of Armando629, Gracias!\\t\\tPoured with a dark brown color and a medium sized beige, creamy lacing head. Caramel, molasses, cellar, plum, raisin, licorice and plenty of hops in the aroma. Dry, sweet taste with bitter finish. Light body with high carbonation. Delivers.[2186-20090520] Tap. Mild peat aroma. Black body with a thick long-lasting off-white head. Some peat malt continues in the flavour with some light roasting. Full body, a little rough. Not as smooth as Guinness but good as it stands.\\t(@ Bru Bar; Cork, Ireland)Unfortuneatly Beamish is widely overlooked by the General Stout consumer by the that other Dry Stout.  For those that feel it is a bit thin do a side by side with Guiness (Guiness is one of the lightest on the market)Jan. 15, 2006; on tap @ JFK Airport, NYC\\t\\tA rushed review, unfortunately.  Sampled right after a Murphys Irish Stout, to which it compared favorably. My scrawling on the back of a business card says: \"GREAT\" and makes note of the pleasant aroma . . .  :-)Happy St. pattys 07!!!....draught can into glass...almost black in color...nice tan head...looks like a guinness for sure...the taste is very similar as well ...molasses and raw coffee...and a nice bitter aftertaste yet smooth all at once...I keep comparing to guinness because its such a well known staple as far as draught stout cans go...it has more of a silkier mouth feel...dare I say I like it better...well I do...:)...its all about the coffee in stouts for me... the more,  the merrier I amDraught at Sheehans in Dublin. Dark black with a foamy, fine, tan head. Malty, slightly sweet aroma with chocolate. Creamy, chocolatey, rather sweet flavor, though no overly so. Ok roasted character, with some coffee and a touch of sour. Not highly carbonated. Finish is dry, well roasted, and creamy with a touch of sweetness. Good but rather subdued. Could have more flavor.Beamish, Id been wanting to try this for some time now. Im sampling a 16oz can with the floating widget.  Nice black opaque body with a creamy tan head that could support a lead weight. The flavor and aroma are rich and roasty, charred maltyness, a bit smoky. The palate is as full as they come, with a dry finish. Overall, a fine creamy concoction!Tasted from nitro-can into standard pint glass. Poured a very dark reddish-brown color with some chill haze and thick, creamy beige head, somewhat lasting with lace. Aromas of grain, bread, roasted barley and some fruity ale yeast esters. Flavors of fresh black bread, toast, black coffee and dark chocolate, a little caramel, nuts, molasses, some apricots, plums and sour cherries. Medium body. Round, roasty mouthfeel. Dry but not harsh or astringent. Very smooth, fruity aftertaste. Delicious.Can. Pours near black with a creamy beige nitro head. Light chocolatey and roasty aroma. Smooth nitro body. The flavor is nicely roasted with a touch of chocolately sweetness. Better then I expected.This was a pretty decent Irish beer.  This poured a typical black color with a nice white head.  The body was very thin and the finish was a little stale.  Not that bad though.Tight light tan head and black in color.  Lots of roasted coffee, wonderfully dry and slightly dusty with an appatizing bitterness and  coffee grounds in the finish.Pours black from 14.9 ounce nitro-can. Smooth creamy tan head. Plenty of lacing.\\t\\tAroma is coffee, roasted malts, mildly bitter.\\t\\tFlavor is coffee, toasted malt, mild hops, some chocoate.\\t\\tPalate is average.\\t\\tOverall a nice light stout. Sessionable for sure. Paid $2.49 US for the can.Draft. Clear black colour, nitrogen head. Weak roastmalty aroma. Flat, roastmalty taste, with hints of coffee, ending in medium dry finish. Thinbodied.  Its not offensive, but I cant see me drinking this again. Too bland and watery.Chocolate head, creamy and tasty. Very dark, coffee bean aroma and taste, A bit dry, a bit salty, very much chocolate and sweet, smooth mouthfeel. Long finish again with roasted malts and coffe. Bought at Lovbjerg Supermarket.Draft. Creamy off-white head sustains throughout pint. Almost opaque flat black color. Little to no bite; mild toasted grain flavor. Somewhat thinnish, but not nearly as weak as that Guinness crapola. Not very lively in the glass, but not as flat as that Guinness crapola. Very average, which is way better than that Guinness crapola.very creamy,nice head, somewhat flat tasing for a stoudt, maybe the can has something to do with itPretty good, but not as good as Boddingtons. Very Guinness-like, but not the same flavor. Overall, a good buy.I guees you can call me partial to Irish stouts but I really like this beer. A mild roastiness for the malts along with the smooth creaminess wins me over.Classic Irish Stout. Dark brown with a pronounced roasted grain flavour. Pours very creamy head. Went down faster than Guinness.Malty and roasted, nice coffee and bitter taste, but a little thin-bodied to my taste. Yet better than Guinness.Pours a very creamy brown that settles to a cream mocha head atop a dark mahogany body.  Smells malty, and toasted.  Tastes about the same as Guinness, but with a tart bite.  Not as good as Guinness.Very friendly dry Irish stout. Not quite the character of Guinness. Good beer. Creamy, malty, decent body. pleasantly bitter. Nice beer. too bad not made in Ireland. Having a draft of this at Bodega downtown La Crosse, WI USAOn tap in Dingle? Opaque blackish brown body with a creamy tan head. Aroma of coffee, chocolate. Taste of coffee, chocolate. Similar to Guinness, but the finish is harsher. Ok for one pint, but after a few my taste buds start to complain. Id take Muphys first Guinness second, and then Beamish.Its Guinness with hops!  Pours exactly the same as a Guinness, very creamy head and dark as night body.  Theres not a whole lot of flavor going on here either, but the bitterness in the finish makes it a much better choice than Guinness.Got the widget can: dark as the inside of a squirrel\\'s arse, fluffy, eternal head that gives it an amazingly smooth and creamy body at first. When it warms up, it becomes watery. Nice caramel nose shows promise, but the taste doesn\\'t follow up: some espresso, unpleasantly sour at first with a lingering subdued bitterness. You could do better ...Pours very dark and thck - with a lavish brown nitro-type head.  Silky and lightly creamy, but a bit thin on the palate.  Decent roasted flavor, but not much compared to some other more complex stouts.I cant seem to figure out why so many people have rated this beer as weak. This is a medium bodied stout that has a coffee like taste. Lots of bitterness in every drink I took. If you like stout this one is worth a try.UPDATED: OCT 24, 2005 Like Guinness.  Slightly different flavors, but same character as canned Guinness Draught.Look exactly like Guiness.  A solid dry stout.   A little bland for my taste.  I much prefer the imperial stout to a dry stout.  A bitter chocolate roaster flavor.  Just not much too it as far as flavor.Draught. Small but lasting off-white creamy head. Pitch black body. Weak roasted malt flavor without much coffee as expected. Mild and smooth though. Low carbonation. Short aftertaste.Widget can.  Poured with a lovely, creamy head, and looked like cocoa until it settled like a cappacino.  Mild flavor, roasted malt, and finishes with sweet chocolate and a little bit.  I prefer this to Guinness, even if it is a little more watery than Gunniess.  It\\'s sweeter, however, and is more mild and enjoyable to drink.  Not quite as burnt.Good Irish (Dry?) stout.  Have to say better than Guinness out of the tap.  Dark with slight head.  Bitter like dark chocolate, but not heavy or thick.  Not what Id grab when in the mood for a \"stout\" but still a good beer.Pours nice and dark. Nice malty nose. The taste, however, comes off as way too watery and overly smooth. I just not real impressed by what I tasting here.Dark brown color.  Tan, firm head.  Bubbles that head to the bottom of your glass.  Very light malts in the aroma along with light chocolate malts and some sourness.  Nice flavor.  Light roasted malts and a hint of chocolate but also a nice sour, dry finish. Such a smooth mouth I hardly recognize this as a stout.  The finish is roasted malts, light chocolate, and just a little sourness keeps bringing me back for more.In my humble opinion this stout is second only to Guiness.  I love the dark color and head of the beer.  A smooth light coffee taste that really sits well on the palate.  The other thing is it is significantly cheaper than Guiness and that is much appreciated.  I will definately be drinking this beer again.440 mL nitro can from Asheville Wine Market. Pours a dark brown color with a large creamy head. Good retention and lacing. Aroma of roasted malts and chocolate. Taste is bitter roasted malts and coffee with some chocolate and tobacco notes. Full bodied and overall fairly pleasant.UPDATED: NOV 18, 2011 Re-rate 11/17/11: Nitro-can sample at a tasting at Sar HaMashkaot Ramat Gan. Thanks zvikar. Dark brown to black-colored with a beige head. Roasty aromna with some chocolate and coffee with a bit of milk. Flavor is a bit sweetish, roasty and somewhat coffee-ish, with pleasant bitterness in the finish. Medium-bodied. 7/3/6/3/13=3.2\\t\\tDraught. Black beer with a stable, small, creamy brown head. Roasty aroma with some coffee. Flavor is sweetish and malty, with roastiness and notes of coffee. Some roasty bitterness in the finish. Mouthfeel is quite watery but also has a creamy aspect. OK. 6/4/6/2/12=3I dont care if it comes in a can or not, this beer is one of the finest specimens to ever come out of a brewery. A+Nice thick creamy head and pleasent malty aroma. Taste is a little rich with a burnt coffee flavor and a strong sweet after taste.Very nice Stout, a little on the Guinness tasting side.Almost black, clear with a very creamy off-white head.The aroma is a little thin, giving some coffee. The body... also a little thin, has some lactose sweetness and chocolate. Some roast bitterness comes out in the finish. Its a clean simple  dry stout.Can.  Poured like any Irish stout tends to... as dark as when the lights go off with a beige head on top that never really goes away.  Really nice roasted aroma.  This is the best part of the beer.  First thing that popped into my head after it went in my mouth was \"this is really watered down\".  Automatic reaction?  Guinness Light.  I like the taste of this more than, say, Murphys, but the palate issues are too much of a concern for me.  Id like a bit more thickness, otherwise this would be great.Draught in Estonia. Pure sweetness. The beer came and it had a great black color and gets bonus points for the amazing velvety tan head. Weakest area is the nose where the coffee aroma is pretty weak but the taste is quite good with coffee and dark chocolate predominating.Canned(500ml). -excellant stout, coffee nose, malt flavor with creamy and peppery notes, great rich head, bitter finishBlack color, thick creamy.  Slightly smokey malt aroma.\\tSmokey malt flavor with chocolate undertones. Very creamy palate.Widget Can.I would never give up guinnes for this beer. However, I was very pleased with it. It does not have as complex a flavor as Guinnes(and Guinness isn\\'t that complex), but it is very creamy and a little sweeter than Guinness. I would not be very disappointed if it was my only choice in a restaraunt/pub every once in a while. As you can see though, I think it\\'s main downfall is nearly everyone compares it along side GUINNESS.Very simaller to Guinness.  Typical nitro pour, huge white creamy head.  The only taste is very mild coffee.  A very thin body and texture.  The texture is very creamy yet watery.  It was allright, but I prefer Guinness.The best part about this stout is its price.  I am in Ireland and this stuff is usually 50 cents cheaper than Murphys or Guinness.  Its a good stout but not the best.  If you need a cheap drink in Ireland this is it but if you want a good stout Go Guinness in Dublin and Murphys Cork.Tinned, Nitro. Dark brown balck, tan head. Deep roaste malt but little else, highly fzzed into a sludgy mess.Nitro can, 500 ml Pours a cloudy, blurry light brown color that turns into very dark brown with mahogany hues. Head grows slowly and becomes a medium, solid, prototypical nitro-crem that never collapses.\\tAroma is malty, toasted, rather strong with notes of plums, raisins, prunes, figs and some lactose, grains and wheat.\\tFlavor is bittersweet, burnt with touches of torrified coffee grains, toasted bread, rye, licorice and high cacao dark chocolate.\\tBody is medium to big. Ultra-smooth texture, creamy and silky. Almost no carbonation. Alcohol is there in form of a trace of diacetyl. Bitter and simple finish. I think its better than Guinness Draught.Smoother taste than Guinness, but not as thick or as rich, 2 qualities that realy hurt this beer. Same great appearance and gorgeous head though. Very good overall, half a notch below Guiness and Samuel Smiths.It\\'s no Guinness, but it comes pretty close.  I would have to say that it has a little less kick than Guinness and it seemed kind of flat.Nitro can, served in an English pint.  Dark, dark brown in color (essentially black) with massive, marshmallowy thick nitro head.  Roasty, charred aroma, perhaps a little smoke.  Flavor initially bitter hop, but blink and youl miss it as it is quickly pummeled with roast and coffee notes.  Aftertaste has hints of bittersweet cocoa.  Finish is watery, with some herbally/green notes.  Ultra-thin mouthfeel.Dark opaque black with a large frothy head.\\tDark chocolate, not particularly sweet or bitter. Very one-dimensional, but it seems to fit the category very well. Effects of nitrogen very noticeable. Nothing special in my opinion.Aroma was pretty non-descript, and the appearance is just beautiful, but that is pretty standard for a nitrogen beer, you have to love the way the head moves up.  Decent roast and malt flavor, with coffee evident, a little bitter at the end, which got alot worse as the beer got a little warmer.  Also thought it was a little thin for a stout, the body was kind of watery.  Not bad, but nothing to write home about either.Can. Pours a dark color with all of those bubbles and a big head. Aroma is roasty. Coffee and malts. Nice creamy mouthfeel. Flavor of roasted malts, coffee bitterness.UPDATED: NOV 22, 2005 On tap. Watery for a stout but excellent for a macro nitro. Roasted and bready malt flavors; drier and simpler than Guinness, which is a plus for some tastes.Not bad.  Nice flavor.UPDATED: SEP 18, 2007 Alla spina allo Unicorn di Brescia; stout scialba in una maniera impressionante, peggio della Guinness: aroma inesistente, sapore concentrato nel retrogusto (comunque insipido) e corpo acquosissimo. Sicuramente ha visto tempi migliori, ma ora la Beamish Stout  una roba insulsa.______________ENGLISH TEXT HERE______________On tap at the Unicorn pub in Brescia; lame stout, worse than Guinness: almost lacking in aroma, small flavor only in the finale. Surely it has seen better times.Nitro @ County Cork...  Poured near black with amber highlights and a thick, fluffy, off-white head.  This was pretty much like a more flavorful Guinness.  Smoked malts and chocolate flavors.  Very smooth and low bitterness.Near perfection from a canned beer!  Smells gerat is smmoth has an excellent finish.  Widget can is packaged well and easy to hold. Wonderful overall beer.Another classic in a can. Pours with lots of carbonation, a deep dark chocolate colour. Full overflowing tan head with a nice roasted malt aroma and tofee undertones. Mouthfeel is satisfyingly creamy and chewy- carmel, chocolate, coffee beans and eggplant (i know, wierd but i caught it somewhere). A friendly brew all around.Can pours black with a marshmellow thick light tan head.  Has little to no aroma.  I detect bittersweet chocolate.  Has a medium light mouthfeel  that is very creamy.  Flavor is slight chocolate roast that is smooth on the finish and dry.  A nice session brew this time of year.Dark brown, with a big creamy light tan head from the nitrogen ball. Chocolate aroma. Sweet dark taste.nitro can. pours a deep brown black in that lovely cascading way that good nitro stout should. nice tight khaki head that looks as impenetrable as the beer itself. aroma is dry and roasty. palate is smooth and creamy perhaps a little thin. flavor is minimal, dry with faint roasted malt and even fainter hops.St. Patricks Day-Had to pick betwen Beamish, Guinness, and Murphys and Ive had this beeer the least.  Id say I like it the least of the three.  Pretty harsh finish and not a lot of body.  Not a bad beer, just dont know how much of this 4 pack Ill have right away.I think this beer is simply great!  The Nitrogen ball make a slick sound when you open the can.  The beer was fresh, very tasty, with roasted barley evident but not over powering.  Not sour like Guiness.  I think this is my favorite commercial stout so far.Veyr nice taste, actually, one of the best Stouts I have ever had, compared with the strong ones in sales is good.Dark with a dense fluffy solid white head. Aroma is very light, some roasted malts. Flavor is also very light, nothing bad just light. Some roasted malts and sweetness.UPDATED: AUG 31, 2007 A worthy contender to Guinness Draught. Beautiful to behold but, like any nitro draught beer, the aroma is very underwhelming. Pleasantly creamy body, with a sweeter flavour then Guinness, and slightly less pronounced coffee notes. Long dry finish. Good beerNot much aroma, roasty.  Black as any stout should, great fluffy head that lasts till the end.  Very smooth feels pretty light in the mouth for a stout.  I would drink this before that other Irish Stout any day!  Redlight Redlights got it on draft.Pub Can: Wonderful black stout with 3/4 inch thick velvet cream head. Smells like bittersweet chocolate, like average stout does. Maybe some hint of coffee. Quite smooth, nice bitterness in the flavor. Quite hoppy actually. A very nice stout, wish I had tasted it on tap.Yay, awesome.  I may like this a little better than my beloved GuinGuin, because it has a little more HEARTY ROASTED FLAVOR.  Not as creamy as the first swig of Guin.  But still very excellent.UPDATED: FEB 9, 2006 Can - I love the widgets.  Like Guinness Draught, it gives this stout a wonderfully fine carbonation with a full, long lasting head and nice lacing.  As advertised, the palate is silky smooth, though a touch thin.  Smooth and easy to drink, this stout would actually work fine as a session beer.One of the better nitro-can stouts that I\\'ve had. Decent roasted malt flavor with hints of coffee, chocolate, and a buttery-nuttiness. A roasted bitterness lingers after a sip. More bitter than Murphy\\'s, but not as bitter as Guinness.50 cl can, Fargo, ND, USA. Jet black colour, thick unyielding head. Milky/cream and burnt cocoa aroma. Medium body but the aftertaste makes it feel thick. Enough carbonation for interest, nice long bitter finish.UPDATED: FEB 22, 2003 widget induced beauty..blots of red gleam escape...weak coffee cream...overbearing metalicness at first..like chewing on tin foil...it actually hurt...Beer wasn\\'t meant to come in cans...although cans come in handy at the beach..However I would never drink a dry stout on the hot sunny beach...besides all that there does seem to be nice roasted taste and mellow smoothness..metalicness subsides..I\\'ll say this.. its at least as good as guiness...if not a tad better...I wouldn\\'t mind trying one of these on tap..actually not all that bad..the more I drank the more I liked itA great Irish stout! I was surprised how many people in Northern Ireland told me to drink Beamish. Draught (well chilled) at a local pub. Nice black colour with a creamy light brownish head, good malty and roasty aroma, and the taste...yummmm..wheat and malt, good round roasted flavour, creamy mouthfeel, nice well lasting aftertaste.  Welcome to Ireland me lad!I cant tell this one from Guinness I like it.Nitro can at the Sharp Edge Beer Emporium.  Pours black brown, off white head. Aroma is malt, molasses. chocolate, coffee. Flavor is smoke, paper, chocolate, molasses, anise, coffee.the taste is black and roasty. mmm!  the head is THICK and the colouris dark as can be.  absolutely no transparency.  Not very sweet, but it is creamy... better than guinness.UPDATED: MAY 2, 2007 A great stout.. the only reason this is getting below a 4 is its feminine fairy-like ABV. 4%?? Plz, girlfriend.UPDATED: DEC 10, 2005 A solid stout, but not a great one.  Less flavor and smaller head.  Great appearance and aroma.Nitro draft @ lbaren, Copenhagen. Jet black body  with a small creamy tan head. Hard to find some aroma in this beer, but i can smell something, damn nitro keg! Weak flavor, some metallic bitterness. Very creamy palate.Black pour with a thick tan head.  Roasted malt and coffee aroma.  Mouthfeel is a bit thin but creamy.  Flavor is a lot more coffee, some smoke, vanilla.  Bitter finish.  Not really interesting.Pours nicely w/  creamy tan head, more roasty malt flavor compared to its cousin Guinness, a bit thin on the palate, very drinkableHad in Ireland literally down the street from the brewery. Near black, with a nice off-white head which pales next to Guinness. Typical Stout flavor, chocolate with roast malt. Not a head turner.Foamy think head. I cant notice much or an aroma. Flavor is of coffee and a little bit chocolate.This beer pours much like any other Irish stout - little fluffy white head and very dark body.  It smells much like coffee and tastes the same.  I am not a fan of coffee, but if you are, you would probably like this beer.This is for the can version.  Very similar to Guinness, however, it doesnt have that bitter, slightly sour bite and it wasnt as roasted.  I would almost call this Guinness Light from a flavor standpoint.Tap. A heavy, slightly burned aroma with some hints of coffee and black chocolate. Creamy, light-brown head. A full body with a soft carbonation and a dark finish. Very nice one! Too bad that it is not so easy available as GuinnessI had this beer on tap in a small village in northern Germany (north sea coast area). A heavy, slightly burned aroma with some hints of coffee and black chocolate. The well known creamy, light-brown head of an irish stout. A full body with a soft carbonation and a dark finish. Very delicious! Too bad that it is not so easy available as GuinnessPours nearly opaque black with beautifully contrasting tan head.\\t\\tNose has some fresh grain malt aromas and faint cocoa.\\t\\tOn the palate the roasty flavors come through nicely with a modest amount of hops for balance. Medium to light bodied. Very, very drinkable for a dry irish stout.UPDATED: DEC 24, 2010 Widget can. Rich dark brown, almost black color, with creamy, foamy, wonderful tan to off-white head. Aroma was rich and roasty malts, including chocolate, caramel, and coffee aromas. Flavor was slightly bitter to start, but settles into roasted malt, and rich, dark chocolate malts, and coffee flavors as well. A hint of smokiness. Very creamy and smooth to the palate. Wonderful dry malt finish. Is this better than Guinness? Its close. I think Guinness is great, but this is right next to it. This stout is a little milder, and in some respects, its every bit as flavorful, but even smoother to drink. Definitely one I will enjoy as long as its made.Can:  Dark brown pour with a finger of the creamiest, silkiest beige head I can remember.  Rich aroma is sweet and roasty with heavy maltiness and espresso.  Light chocolate.  Dry, roasty and bittersweet in the flavor profile.  A little chocolate, but mostly the heavy roast.  Nice.UPDATED: NOV 14, 2007 Sort l med tykt skum fet i lufthavnen i Helsinki.\\t\\tMinder utroligt meget om Guinness.\\tBrndt smag og lakrids duft.\\t\\tFlad/CaskOn tap in West Cork.  I agree with Rstump on this one- once youve had Beamish (or Murphys), youll be ordering it instead of Guinness.  Enjoyed many pints at the local in Bantry this past summer.  Its more creamy than Guinness in my mouth and wont dissappoint any fan of Irish stout.  I just wish I could fly to Ireland every month because Im too spoiled by the real thing and wont bother buying it overseas.  BTW- I intended to visit the brewery in Cork City, but its been closed by the new owners at Heineken.  Word is that theyll donate the property to the university and it will reopen as a museum.Much heavier stout than Guinness. Very creamy head, with a slightly sweet aftertaste, which distinguishes itself from other stouts ive tried. great value as well, usually around 3.70 a pint. Definetly worth every penny and moreCan with widget. First canned beer rated by me here. Great color and decent enough aroma. I was expecting a very hearty brew, but one sip in and I was very disapointed. One the palate the mouthfeel was very thin and watery, like something was missing. The taste was also a bit lacking. All bark and no bite.Thanks to Gypsy19 for this one! \\t~Pours black with reddish tints and small lasting creamy brown head.\\t~Aroma is pretty weak. Some hints of chocolate/coffee and malt, but thats all my sniffer is picking up.\\t~Roasted malts, smoke, and some bitter coffee flavor in the taste.\\t~Smooth creamy feel with bitter coffee finish.\\t~Except for the aroma this is a good nitro stout. Smooth and creamy. Easy to down a few with friends while at the pub.Very similar to the big G with a touch more bitterness.Great appearance.  Very similar to the Guinness version, but with a darker, heavier head and very thick lacing that coats the side of the glass.  Aroma is roasted, with a sweet, cake-like quality.  Taste is quite dry, not as robust as I expected based on the aroma, with a dry mouthfeel and the expected roasted, coffee like finish.  Very decent for this category, I actually think the aroma is the best quality of this beer.Good stuff.  Coffee, coffee and more coffee.  Both in the aroma and flavor.  Nice stout without question.UPDATED: MAR 18, 2005 Tasted in the Irish Stout Vertical on St Pattys Day 05Nice roast levels with some creamy lactose. The flavor is light due to the nitro but its noticably more robust than guinness draught (not the carbonated extra however).Rerate from a 3.3 overall.Finally a decent pint at JetRock in the philly airport.  Very drinkable, nicely roasted, great body.  What a relief.  (And I not even a Stout-guy)widget can....very very dark with a ruby/garnet red color. head is creamy beige and lasting. aroma is very light with coffee notes and \"airy\" if that makes any sense. flavor is mild coffee with soured milk flavors.What an incredibly creamy beer!  Not much aroma and not  lot of flavor.  It has a delightful foam to it that stays through the end.  There is a slight bitterness and some roastiness but the flavor is very subtle.  The hallmarks of this beer are the mouthfeel and the creamy appearance.  The downside was that it tended to thin out toward the end.Excellent, creamy stout. Better than GuinnessThis is amongst my favorite stouts, i prefer it to Guinness and most others. Lovely appearance, very black. I also love the smokey flavor of this brew, its very pronounced to me, tho many people dont notice it as much. An eminently drinkable stout.porter and stout tasting 02:  black, creamy head.  faint roasty aroma.  smooth, but slightly thin mouthfeel.  nice roasted and coffee flavours.  dry-ish finish.May 28, 2005  \\tThis was neat looking when I poured it , good for an Irish Stout. A bit sour in my opinion. I got it in the can watch out when you open it... sprayed all over the counter top \\tfrom my old usernamePub can at home produced a pleasurable pour as the beer cascades, then settles, in layers. The softest hint of smokey roast in the nostrils precludes a taste that holds a medium soft creamy smoothness, a Guiness with the slightest coffee flavoring. I find it difficult to argue with something as simple and basic as milk... a March-April staple.Can-poured in to a pint glass\\t\\tWonderful fine nitrogen widget induced tan super creamy head, black color, very fine lacing., nice creamy full body with toned down roasted malt flavor. tastes like a guiness but nothing all that special or different.Can:  Aroma is all chocolate malt.  No real aroma of coffee or anything else.   Pours a dark brown, virtually black, with a nice creamy off-white head with excellent retention.   Taste is virtually all coffee.  No real chocolate flavor.  Outside of the great looking head, its almost like watered down  black coffee that has been sitting at room temperature too long.  I mean this in taste and texture.  Very thin.  Light coffee and bitter aftertaste.  Very unimpressive.  Smell and appearance are going to give this beer an inflated score compared to if you just rated it on flavor.Black ale, lasting creamy beige head (nitro). Roasted (burned) aroma. Roasted flavour too. Notes of coffee and faintly smokey. Anise? Dry. Somewhat watery palate. Very drinkable indeed. Impressive irish style dry stout.Nitro can: Pours a pitch black with a thick foamy tan head.  Aroma is chocolate, caramel, malts, and a light heath bar scent.  Taste is creamy malts, chocolate, and somewhat of a roasted nut taste.  Palate is dry and bitter with a little sweetness to it.  Overall, I liked this Dry Stout.  Its nice and creamy and rather tasty.On tap, with Nitro at ODowds in KC.  Call me crazy, but I have a sneaking suspicion that this wants to be on par with Guiness.  Not quite there.  Looks like a nitro Guiness pour.  Dark as night with a frothy head.  Very smooth to drink, but also very bland.  I guess it was creamy, but thats pretty much it.  Really not much going on.UPDATED: MAY 13, 2005 St. Pats Day 2005, Crescent Moon Ale House (Omaha).  Ive been a Guiness loyalist for a while.  Ive had more than my fair share of that beer; probably more than any other beer (it was my beer of choice before expanding my tastes).  I have to say, however, that after this week, I might say that Beamish is better.  The Reasons: 1) it has the same level of creaminess as Guiness but retains more body and buttery goodness throughout the stages of mouthfeel.  Ive always liked Guiness initial, head-infused creaminess, but disdained a bit the wateriness underneath.  Beamish is more stout.  2) Better hop character.  Guiness is bitter and hoppy, but metallicly so; Beamish had a nice round hop bitter that I didnt expect from such a widely available, commercial beer.  It was still subdued compared to other dry stouts Ive had, but it balanced nicely with the creamy buttery frosting-like malt in the beginning.  If only the finish could linger a bit longer, I would rate this higher, but it was a great surprise to have on St. Pats Day.Roaring boiling pour. Thick sticky lace off white head. Sweet herby malt nose, with notes of chocolate, caramel and roast. What\\'s a good word for un-robust. Let\\'s play with watery. Soft creamy mouth feel. Chewy malty chocolate. Burnt sugar. Dry with a strange flavour in the finish. Pretty good though has little depth. Good with food. Better as it stills.Pitch black with creamy lasting head leaving laces. Weak not of roasted malt and milk/ Sweet and little bitter finish. Soft mouthfeel.Used to drink Beamish when I was a student many years ago. It is still excellent with terrific appearance, aroma and flavour. A Cork legendCan.  Pours Black with a milky white creamy head. Aromas are roasted nuts and bittersweet chocloate. Flavors are very roasted malt.Can 0,5l. Deep red/black coloured. A small creamy head. Quite pretty. Aroma of coffee and liquorice. The coffee and liquorice dominate the flavor accompanied by a burnt bitter aftertaste. Very \"smooth\" and easy drinkable. One of the better canned beers.UPDATED: JUN 13, 2005 (Can 50 cl) Typical dry Irish stout with a rather sharp bitterness and some chocolatey notes. Comes with a nitrogen-widget in the can. 150202Smoother Guinness. Mild roosted malt flavor a little sweeter but still very dry.50 cl can. Very dark brown/red with small creamy off-white head.. Flavour is roasted malt, coffee and a bit watery.Ummmmm, what...hello, i ordered a stout, not this nitroed out flat tap you gave me!!!! Pour was a glacial black with a creamy tannish head, obviously nitroed and no lacing to speak of. Aroma was pretty weak, something of malt and roast coming through, but very thinly spread. The taste was very watery and flat. Some very thin cocoa roastiness, some coffee bean, and a nice drying bitterness, but i didnt enjoy it too much. Very lackluster flavor if any, and too thinly spread at just not the right moments. It\\'s there, but nothing particularly important to remember.Draught at James Joyce Pub in Durham, NC. Roasty aroma and flavor without much hop flavor or bitterness. Nitrogenation makes this a very smooth beer that is soft on the palate. Very easy to drink even for someone who is afraid of stouts.Opening these draught cans STILL gives me pause. Is it gonna overflow, or not?? Pouring into glass, it settles into an inch thick creamy tan head made of extremeley small bubbles. Dark brown beer. Not as bitter as Guinness, but that could be because the Guinness I had was not a draught can. Hops comes out in the aftertaste. Very smooth flavor. Unfortunately, another reviewers description of it being like a cigar is fairly accurate. No special aroma to speak of.  Hopefully, I can find this in a different form someday.This beer was pretty light in flavor.  there was some roast and coffee, but very watered downI will always order this over Guiness if I have the choicein a pub, yet I always buy Guinness from the store rather than Beamish.  Hmm, why is that.  I can\\'t distinguish the two except to say that I find Beamish to be slightly more smokey and slightly less bitter of a finish; however, it seems that most Guinness I get out is more mild than what I have from a store.  Either way, they are both fair, tasty, unassuming beers that don\\'t makethe drinker work to enjoy them.  If you\\'re given the chance to sample this as an alternative to the other Irish Black stuff, give it a whirl, you won\\'t be disappointed.tall boy: pint glass: pours like coffee, leaving .5 finger of tan head.  The nose is faint but some raosted malts ia availble.  The taste is present but not strong, again roasted notes, some coffee, a slight sweetness.  The body itself however is thin and almost watery.. nothing here stands out.  Important to note however, is this beer, despite its weakness, is very characteristic for its style.  For that it rates well, I would personally like to sample an out of the ordinary stout to be honest...Deep and dark with thick light tan head. Chewy mouthfeel.  Light bitterness an light roast.  Flavor doesnt match the appearance.  Like a Guiness with a little sharper, more bitter flavor.I think I prefer this to Guinness on tap, but out of the can they are about the same.  Beamish is a little bit creamier and smooth, but still very tame compared to the new wave american stouts.  PS I love how miller lite drinkers think beers like this are impossible to drink - I dont like to be snobbish but come on!So I told that some idiot at Scottish Newcastle decided to stop exporting Beamish to the US.  What a bummer!  But here I am with quite possibly the last Beamish that Il ever see, right in front of me.  So for #400, I picked out this absolutely superb stout for the milestone.  Great pour Two fingers of head that is completely stagnate.  Talk about a good looking brew!  Bready, grainy aroma from the clinging head. The first drink is a rich creamy foam fest followed by the dry bittersweet chocolate flavor and the coffee roast.  Typical Irish stout, but better than Guinness.  Not quite as bitter.  A little more rounded, and not quite as acidic.  Still great coffee roast and an ebbed oily mouth feel.  I down to the last dregs of the beer and I still have a solid fingerwidth of head.  Some lacing.  Malty caramel, toffee goodness.  Il miss you!Draught @ lbaren. Large retaining creamy head in its true form. Really lasted and made some lovely lacework as well. Black color with a reddish glow. Mild smoke, grain, roasted malt, coffee, chocolate and hint of liquorish. Medium bodied with a soft carbonation and dry texture. Moderated sweet and bitter flavor. Dry malty bitter roasted finish.Pourred a beautiful creamy black brew with a nice foamy head that will stay for a while. Roasted nose with a little water aftertaste. Very similar to Guinness. I had better stout but this one is not that bad.Another good Stout. A little more bitter on the aftertaste than Guinness, but almost right up there on flavor. Nice roasty, chocolaty hints.very good stout. very much like guinness, but slightly not as good.On tap at Rose & Crown in Palo Alto for St. Pattys Day.  Fairly similar to Murphys overall.  Black appearance with off-white nitro head.  Aroma is roasted malt and coffee.  Flavor is roasty with coffee and chocolate, some hops and a little nuttiness.  Really creamy and smooth palate.Poured black with a thick creamy head. Has a black malty aroma. A thin bodied stout,a little watery. Had a plesant light  roasted coffee and  chocolate malt flavor. This was a very tasty stout.Very tasty stout beer that goes down smooth. Very underated beer that gets overlooked by Guinness drinkers in this category of beers. Nice in winter but good anytime of year.Standard Irish dry stout.  I really cannot tell the difference between Guinness, Murphys and this.  I remember in my younger days when these beers were too much.  Ah....the ignorance of youth.  Now these things are so watery.  Good, dont get me wrong.  But not overpowering like I foolishly believed.Pure black color with a thick dark tan head.  Aroma is mainly of malts.  Taste is very mellow.  Theres some malt, chocolate, and slight coffee.  Nothing much in the aftertaste.  Similar to a Guinness but with half the flavor.Grabbed a four pack before theyre gone, using bottle deposit return money. The pour was fantastic, lots of cascading from the widget nitro, leaving a thick and creamy, very beautiful head. As pretty a site as Guinness on the pour, and given the fact my sampling was only from a can: the pillowy 1 inch head left in the bottom of my glass was MORE impressive). Aroma surpassed Guinness, as cocoa came through in and under the roasted coffee and smoke dominent themes. The flavor was very similar, although the cocoa was less noticeable and the smokey (almost peat smoke, like Scottish Ales) aspects were assertive. Good stuff, but I think the Guinness is cleaner and more assertive in flavor. Likewise, mouthfeel wasnt as good as Guinness, a bit thinner. Overall, a very nice beer, but its depature wont be missed by me, as Ill just grab a guinness when I want a top dry stout. Condolences to Beamish.Draught. Pours a black color with a creamy tan head. Sweet malty and slightly roasted aroma with some hints of caramel. Sweet roasted malty flavor. Sweet malty finish with a roasted malty aftertaste.The Smithwicks was good but the Beamish on Tap was even better. Great beer out of the tap. I not a guinness fan but I liked this one far better than Guinness. Chocolately, bitter and super smooth and drinkable. Could have had a couple more but it was time to go. Again had this one at WJ McBrides. Nice Irish Pub worth a trip if you are over near that area.A delightfully delictable brew.  Has a commendable smoothness factor.  Rivals Guiness for Iridh Stouts.  A great beer to drinnk after a long day.Wow!  This beer rates higher than I expected!  The pint I got was served *really* bloody cold though.  That almost certainly affected the flavor.  I was very impressed with the quality of the head on this stout.  It poured a dark dark brown with the thickest, creamiest head I have ever seen on a beer.  Somehow, thought, the palate was dead.  Pretty watery texture.  And not super flavorful.  I also didnt detect anything that I would consider to be a \"dry\" quality.  Although, maybe dry stouts arent supposed to be dry.  This is not my favorite stout.  Although I ought to taste this again when I can control the serving conditions a little bit better.  Im sure I can find this in a bottle somewhere close.Poured from a 440ml nitro-can into a pint glass.  This stout poured a deep brown/black color with a thick, creamy, tan, nitro induced head that would not fade.  Some light lacing was left around the glass.  The aroma of this stout consisted of both sweet and roasted malt, mild coffee, and a few chocolate notes.  The flavor was very creamy with notes of light milk chocolate and coffee.  The roasted malt flavor was very mild when compared to other dry stouts.  The mouthfeel was light-bodied with typical nitro creaminess and minimal carbonation.  This was a decent, and very sessionable stout.Draft. Black beer with a thick creamy tan head. The nose is all roasted malts with overtones of coffee and burned toast. Taste is espresso coffee, roasted malts, a touch of bitter chocolate, hops and vanilla. Finishes dry and slightly bitter.Dark! Has a nice creamy head. Taste from coffee. A little bit thin. Bitter. Havent got a grip of this one. Guess I will re-rate some day...Canned beer.  Just cant seem to get past that.  This poured as a stout should, dark with a creamy tan head.  Notes of coffee, smoke, molasses in the nose.  The mouthfeel was rather thin and watery.  The flavor was weak coffee, molasses, some chocolate, and some metallic notes.  From the can?Poured from a can.  Poured a deep brown color with a thick, dense, off-white nitro head.  Faint dairy smell with a bit of roasted malt peaking through.  Flavor matches the smell for the most part, starts out thin and faint with a bit of cream and leads into a light, slightly bitter roasted finish.  Pretty thin on the palate.  Not really anything to write home about, but it would be something you could drink quite a bit of.Pours a very dark color, borders on black, but not as black as Guinness.  Medium bodied with a creamy head.  Thin malt aroma and flavor... taste seems a bit watery.\\t\\tI was slightly disappointed with this offering.Can. Decent aroma and good head. Very creamy taste that warms up to a pretty good stout and good tatse.draft at Bob Chins in Wheeling, IL / i chose this to top my meal off and it was worth it. its simple and easy to drink. dry, creamy, thin, a bit bitter, and roasty. obviously, theres notes of coffee in this.very watered down, yet nice color, and a slight woody taste.  Guiness is still more for the money, but beamish is very easy to drink.This beer is smoother than Guiness, and has a nice creamy taste. Hands down my favorite on tap.A very good drink.  The appearance was a deep brown.  I loved the way the bubbles appeared to be moving down.  Nice dark long lasting head.  The flavor was bold, but not too strong.  A noticible roasty coffee flavor.bst on tap in Cork. More coffee taste than a Guiness, little more carbonated, still smooth and creamy, but a slightly too bitter finish.can. Aroma of faint hops,chocolate milk and espresso. Very nice dark pour with a huge light brown head. Tasted like coffee or espresso. Very dry finish but at the same time came across very watery. I thought this would be a \"heavy\" beer and it wasnt at all. Kind of odd but good.Roasted malts, a bit of smoky coffee and dark chocolate. Dark brown black and beautiful creamy brownish head. Smooth mouth with light, oily body. Tangy maltiness though a bit metallic (draught can). Bitter hops with smooth, sweet finish and light bitter after. A nice canned draught stout. Improved slightly when warmed from cold to cool.Typical widget beer (I am rating the canned version):  smooth and soft, but not much in the flavor department.  Seems a little weaker than Guinness.Known locally in Cork, where its brewed  as the poor mans pint\". Tastes abit rough on draught when compared  to Guinness and not as sweet as Murphys, which is a good thing for a stout. An aquired taste id say. From a can id prefer it  to either of the above,Canned widget. Black version of Caffreys: same strength, same creamy foam, same draughtflow system. A classic dry stout with elegant taste of roasted barley and coffee. Delicious.Can poured a pure black into my chimay glass,, is that so wrong?  nice chocolate head that lasts! not much of an aroma.\\tTaste is very weak,watery,and bland but then again I rate my stouts against my love, Stone I.R.S.\\tI dont think I will be buying this again. Not a drain pour but kinda close.Ugh. Just looking at these nitrogen-bastardized beers makes me shudder. Unnatural head with an unnatural beer below. Faintly roasty aroma with a sort of musty nuttiness. Bland flavor with very light roasted malt and faint cigar ash. Dry, very lightly bitter finish. In fact, \"very light\" just about sums this one up. Theres also a sort of plasticine flavor that I cant quite place. Point me in the direction of the real stouts.16 oz nitro can. No freshness date noted.\\tDark brown/black with ruby highlights. Creamy tan head leaves thick sheets of lace.\\tAroma is roasty and chocolate.\\tFlavor is roasted malt, creamy coffee and some  bitter chocolate.\\tFinish is slightly dry.Dark brown body with a nice creamy head.  Aromas of chocolate/coffee, kinda sweet.  A little more bitter than Guinness/Murphys.  This is my favorite of the three nitro can stouts.Great.  But Id rather have a Guinness,A pint can of this (complete with floating widget) was my introduction to Dry Stout.  This brew pours a muddy black with red highlights.  The fully lasting thin creamy brown head is the color and consistancy of a chocolate milkshake.  The nose is mostly malt with hints of cookie, straw, molasses, and of course coffee/chocolate.  Balanced with slightly hoppy and yeasty aromas that hint of flowers, herbs, soap and sweet dough.  The flavor is moderately bitter sweet with a medium finish consisting of chocolate and coffee overtones.  The flat full palate is watery/creamy with a metallic feel to the finish.  Solid.On tap at RFD, Washington, D.C. Not too bad. Deep black color with a tan head. Some caramel, toffee, and roasted malt spring from the head. Kind of dry taste. Little hoppy, but not too much. Some coffee as well. Pretty decent Id say. I was pleased.Prefer this to both Guinness and Murphy\\'s.  Great appearance and big creamy long-lasting  head thanks to the widget in the can.  So smooth(although when on tap it can be a bit more bitter).  Pleasant  aroma of chicory.  Dry, mellow finish.Very creamy,nice head.  Similar to Guinness.My beer of choice for fall and winter.  A warm taste with plenty of body to carry you through the day.Dark, almost black, Has a light brown head, mostly lasting. Milky-roasted aroma, sweet. Flavor is moderate sweet and finish heavy bitter. Dry texture.On tap at the Long Hall, Dublin. Very similar to Guinness. Dark color. Tall head. Wheat flavour. Very cream. Possibly even better than the Irish export of choice.On tap. Dark blackish hue. Thick white foamy head. Roasted malts in the aroma. Sweet dark chocolate, and coffee; light carbonation, light bodied, velvety smooth with a nice crisp bitter finish. Nicely balanced, very quafable, dry stout.I had been told this is a better stout than guinness.  It is definately close, if not on par or better.  Definately something to drink more of for a definite conclusion.  This beer poured extremely dark and with excellent taste.Poured from can, darkest brown, with creamy light tan head.  Mild aroma of chocolate and roasted malt, very subtle.  Smooth mildly sweet taste, goes down easy. Medium bodied with a creamy texture.  Tasted alongside Murphys and Guinness; it was my fave.UPDATED: MAR 22, 2008 Pours black with a large very creamy tan head.  Strong aroma of smoked peat/malt.  Pretty decent stuff.   First taste is strong smoked peat, followed by dry milk chocolate malt.  Some coffee in the finish.  Somewhat milky body.   Thumbs up, very fast drinking stout.[widget can] Almost opaque black with a brown colour where you can see light coming through.  Cream coloured head that has a look and retention of Guiness, but lighter in colour.  Roasty aroma with some chocolate and a little noble hops--a bit too subdued.  Unlike the aroma, the flavour is robust with spicy burnt wood and a nice balanced bitterness that comes in quite late.  Also some pete smoke taste and good residual sweetness.  Light to medium body with low carbonation and minor astringency from the black malt and bittering.  Very smooth.0,5 l can. 4,2%. Dark brown color. Nice, small, creamy brown head. Sweetness in aroma and flavor. A bit thin, but not bad at all.Pub Can. Pours a Jet black with a nice cream head. Light roasted malt nose. Flavors have the roasted malt, slight coffee. Very smooth beer with a bit of a sour hint to it. Decent!Nitro head. Nice smell, nothing confusing here, you know your getting a sweet malty beer. Lacing is thick as mold, and kinda looks like it. Taste is strong of coffee, light on bitter chocolate. Malty aftertaste. Smooth dry mouthfeel. Great beer.UPDATED: DEC 6, 2008 [nitro draft - MacGregors - Henrietta, NY] Black pour with some slight red hints and a thick and creamy tan head. Very mild roasty aroma with hints of coffee underneath. Dry and bitter flavor with roasted malt hints throughout and a bitter finish. Very smooth and creamy, but a bit thin.I had this beer on tap; I dont think it comes any other way around here.  My first impression was, what does that taste like again?  I had to try it again, and again, just to remember what it tasted like.  I believe this is due to it not having much flavor.  Its nitrogenated, so any conventional palate and carbonation immediately becomes a non-factor.  Smooth.  A little too smooth, and not quite enough maltiness or hops in this one for me.  I like my stouts bold, this one is meek.On tap at the Crescent Moon. This was the pint nite beer, so I got to keep the 20 oz imperial pint glass. Great coal-black color with an ivory white head. The head is pretty much of a whipped cream texture. Dense and creamy. No overpowering aroma, just a mild solid roasted aroma. Flavor is a burnt roasty malt. Smooth palate. Very dry finish, almost demanding that you have another.Nitro Can.   Black but not opaque, with a creamy beige head.   Very chocolatey aroma with some sweet caramel, tootsie rolls, a fruity yeast profile, and a touch of staleness.   Fruitier flavor than Guinness of Murphys, with a touch of caramel character that the others dont have.   Bitter chocolate with a hard minerally finish, but also some roundness from the yeast and caramel.   A little stale overall, but the winner of our Big Irish Three blind tasting due to a little better balance and complexity.Smoky, coffe flavor - pretty standard Irish Stout with a slightly fruity (apple?) and bitter finish.  Nice flavor, but way too watery and thin mouthfeel for my taste.UPDATED: JUN 29, 2003  Black in color with a huge creamy tan head, weak roasty aroma, bland and weak flavor, it is thin and watery, yet has a creamy mouthfeel from the nitro, overall very bland and flavorless, not much going on here, pretty much just like the bland Guinness.Can. Black color with moderate creamy head. Light roasted malt aroma. Medium body with a smooth texture. Good well balanced malty coffee flavor with a watery finish.I read recently Beamish will not be imported to USA anymore due to Scottish & Newcastles shift in marketing to focus on selling more Newcastle Brown Ale.    I never sampled Beamish until @ a St. Patricks Day Party on Friday night.    Widget can gave up a black bodied Dry Stout with slight hint of chocolate roasted malts.Rubbish stout.\\tno aftertste, weak bodied and faint of the roast malts it supposidly has.\\ttastless macro. theres no bite at the back of the throat. no rich malt taste.Schne Krone.

Definitely would recommend to any dry stout lover.Its like a softer version of Guinness. Very pleasant to drink. Creamy, Cofee aroma, soft on palate, but very bitter at the end. Its amazing to see the head forming as you pour it on the glass.(draught can)\\tThe head disappears quickly.  It is a pretty oderless beer.  The smell is not strong at all.  Definately has the edge of a stout, and has a little bitterness to it.  Definatley worth trying, but not one of my favorite stouts.  It just tastes like it is missing something to me.Draught.\\tBrown coloured with a creamy off white head.\\tRoasted aroma of coffee with notes of liquorice.\\tNot much carbonation.\\tRoasted flavour of chocolate and liquorice with fruity notes.Not bad, but I am still not a fan of those widget things.

Extremely dark.  Smooth tasting at first with a chocolaty nose.  The aftertaste is full of coffee beans.  I was pretty impressed.  I like this way better than guiness.UPDATED: MAR 17, 2005 Smooth, slightly bitter taste, creamy everlasting head, mild finish with notes of coffee.440ml Can\\t$7.99 4-Pack\\tBinnys Orland\\t\\tStarting my St. Patricks Day celebration a day early! Beamish Irish Stout pours black with the beautiful cascade from the widget. When backlit faint mahogany highlights shine through. The insanely creamy khaki head grew to a generous one finger and left thick sheet lacing all the way down the glass. Some people dont like those widgets but they sure do help produce a feast for the eyes!\\t\\tThe aroma is pretty basic and somewhat hard to pull out. Im afraid this is because of that damn widget and the dense head it created. Dense roasty grains and even a slight floral quality do eventaully come through and rieminds me a lot of Murphys.\\t\\tBeamish is a bit sweet upfront before the slightly bitter roastiness takes over. The roastiness pushes throughout and finishes a bit minerally. Fairly basic but good none the less. One of the benchmarks of the style.\\t\\tThe widget creates a nice creamy hearty mouthfeel. Smooth and utterly creaminess and finishes with a slight roasty bitterness on the sides of the tongue.\\t\\tA very easy drinking stout.

Basically follows the lines of the other two but I have to say this is my favorite of the three big Irish Stouts. Slainte!\\t\\t3/17/07Can@Home. Chocolate, malts and a hint of black berries aroma. Brown colour, light brown head, good lace. Light sweet, roasted malts, bitter. Flavourful, highly drinkable.nitro can, served in a Samuel Smith english pint glass.  After the waterfall settles from the pour, its a nice black beer topped by a thick tan head which stays and laces. Aroma is a weak point, a bit acrid and hoppy.  A little watery, but decent flavors of coffee and roasted malts.  Creamy and a bit of bitterness and sourness.  Almost on a par with the Murphys, maybe slightly better than the Guinness Draught.  An enjoyable and satisfying brew.Bottle.  Pours pretty dark with a thick creamy head.  Roasted aroma, with a definite coffee aroma as well.  Coffee flavor, with a very creamy palate.  Id have to say this one was very refreshing.a nice irish stout\\tvery similar to guiness. \\tmaybe a little overpricedA very bland Stout.  Typical stout/dark color.  Not anywhere near as good as Guinness, but not bad either.  I guess Id rather have a micro-brew stout.A Guinness knock-off. All things being equal, Guinnes would be my choice.A quality beer that you could opt for if you cant get some Guinness.  The after-taste is a little different but still very good.Draft and can. The body looks bubbly and translucent with a thick, creamy head.  Aroma of roasted malts and sweet chocolate. Burnt malt flavor and a long, dry finish. Thin to medium body and medium to high carbonation.Great not the best but good. smooth really smooth. good strong flavor.Poured from a 440ml Nitrogen Can.

Finishing with a soapy bitterness. Dry finish. Good head rentention and very nice lacing of the glass. Drinkable but light.Can we say Guinness? I really dont know what else to say, it was the exact same thing.500ml can. Thanks, BitBucket! Pours opaque black with a moussy, almost pillow off-white head. Gorgeous nose; chocolate and grass--sweet and complex. Actually gets you looking forward to the beer even though it doesnt smell an awful lot like a stout. The attacks pretty mild, though; thin, watery, and that weird chalky cream common to beers on a widget (though this one isnt, it seems to have suffered the same fate). Sour metallic notes near the finish, and the finish does hang around but not by way of doing much to dispel the problems of the mid-palate.Can. Nice microfoam head with excellent duration. Color is dark brown. Aroma and taste are roast malt, licorice and hops. Smooth and creamy.can. pours awsome. huge very smooth and creamy lasting head with a nice cascading effect. and a nice dark red body. apperance one of the best looking beers ive seen. but then you smell it. very light malt and roast character not bad until you taste it very thin, very watery, pretty much flavorless. malt and that light roasted character again pretty much a waste of time not in the least exciting. very nearly a drain pour.Rated 3/17/06:  Grabbed a 4 pack the other day in anticipation of enjoying them tonight during the NCAA Tournament, which happens to coincide with St. Pattys day so win/win. The best pour of any Irish Stout I have ever had, comes out of the draught can creamy and immediately begins to cascade down in my pub glass. A thick creamy head blankets the top of my glass and stays throughout the entire beer, even after the beer is gone the head remains in the bottom of the glass. Intense lacing sticks to the glass. The color is a rich dark mahogony. Strong aroma is present making me aware of the roasted malts that dominate this beer. All of the other Irish Stouts I have sampled had a faint aroma that was hard to detect, Beamish lets you know right away that you are going to enjoy their brew. The mouthfeel is smooth and velvety, this stout is beyond creamy with an exceptional finish. The flavor is bursting with rich roasted malts. Undertones of coffee are present. It is now known that Beamish is on the outs and this is unfortunate because in my opinion Guinness is very good, Murphys is better, but Beamish is the cream of the crop. My only regret is that I was not able to discover this beer sooner. Fantastic Dry Stout, Im going back to the store to stock up.Widget Can-This is a good stout, very drinkable, but not as good as Guinness draught.  It didnt seem to be as dry or have nearly as good a finish as Guinness, or even Murphys.Mm.. a nice stout.  Not over the top in heft at all.  Nice bubbles, but nothing near a Guiness in attitude as it pours.  Very little head for a stout.  The can says its silky and its right--the stuff looks silky as its poured.  I enjoyed.  Not my favorite stout, but I enjoyed.14.9 oz can.  Pours nearly black, can see some dark ruby when you hold it up to the light with a 1.5cm tan dense head that is mostly lasting.  Of course is does the rolling head display, not quite as impressive as other beers in the class.  Aroma is roasted malt and some sweet cream.  Initial flavor is sweet, creamy, and roasted all at the same time.  Flavor ends on the roasted notes then to a dry, slightly bitter aftertaste.  Some lacing, no carbonation once its poured, medium to full body, no alcohol noted.  Drinkable, but with better options in the category, might be a long time before Il be having this one again.Lost plenty of overall impression points for being too thin.  I think Murphys is eve thicker.  Ive had this on tap in a pub and from the bottle. Unremarkable, I prefer any Guinness to this.  This is very well-balanced, highly chugable, and woth every penny, but its really not worth writing hom about.  If youve had the new Guinness in the bottle with the rocket widget, and liked it, youll enjoy this one too.Much better than Guinness and Murphys, but that aint sayin much, frankly.  More chocolately and similar to American stouts than the other two Irish dry stouts. Also, not sour and unpleasant. Not a great beer, but probably the best beer out of Ireland.  Try Rogues Shakespeare Stout instead.Comparable to Guinness. Had this in Dublin. Smooth , creamy and easy to drink. No carbonation. Mild and  dark with a burnt hoppy taste . Good stuff.i like it,this one goes down with my all time stouts.Once the nitro pour storm settles down, the beer is a nice thick brown-black, topped by a thick and creamy head of tan foam. Great head retention and spotty lacing. A tangy and roasted malt aroma is quite noticeable.\\t\\tSmooth and dry roasted malt flavor, with a touch of black coffee in there too. Medium bodied, quite mellow. Delicious when the mood strikes.\\t\\tIf I recall correctly, Beamish is known as the Protestant stout, while Murphys is the Catholic stout. Looks like a trip to the confessional for me on Sunday - I like Beamish better.Keg @ Grne Jgaren, StockholmBeer #800. What a way to celebrate at a place like this and a beer like this to go... Roasted, sweet with a dry finish. A bit of toffe, and to a degree a hint of cheap chocolate. Served freezing cold with plenty of gas.Not a bad stout.  I not a big fan of the weaker stouts but this is good.  Nice roast malt flavors without the sweetness.UPDATED: MAR 29, 2007 Rerate, tap: Neutral aroma.\\tChestnut, big creamy nitro head.\\tDusty roast notes, a bit wood.\\tFairly lightbodied - served too cold of course.\\tLight roasted aftertaste \\t########\\tOld rating: 6 5 7 4 13 \\tSampled from can. Widget works very well, very dark and with a nice creamy head. Subdued flavors, but burned toast, coffee and a bit bitterhop can be detected. Creamy mouthfeel but fast exit.A nice stout, the appearance is great, but taste could be better, the beer I had tasted a bit flat, I should try it again. Not a bad flavor, coffee showed a bit, but it could be better.From a widget can. Not as similar to Guinness as many think. Slightly weaker aroma and less head but nice and creamy. Nice lacing. Less coffee/chocolate taste and more of a bitter hops taste. Little aftertaste, but unpleasant nonetheless. A disappointing dry stout.I was intrigued by the can when I bought this, having loved every Irish beer ive tried. Poured very dark with a great head. The taste is wonderful, beats the hell out of Guinness. Truly one of my favorite beers, ended up drinking all 4 cans at one sitting.Nitro creates fake creamy head that gives illusion that beer will be frothier.  Noteable chocolate and coffee undertones, but really weak in sustenence. Disappointed.An able competitor to Guinness.  Something is just not quite as nice about it.  PLEASE for the love of all that is holy, do not drink from the nitro can -- tastes like metal.  Drink this tasty medium dry stout from the tap, or not at all!14.9 oz can that pours cascades into a pitch black stout.  Aroma has hints of roasted malts but a little lighter than I would like.  Very thick mouthfeel thicker than Guinness which is one of the high points of this brew.  Flavor is little weak up front but blends nicely into a roasted finish.  Not a bad irish stout.UPDATED: JAN 30, 2003 Can.  It looks like Guinness, feels like Guinness, and tastes a little off.  There is a dry waffer, bread, and coffee flavor.Ah, the Guinness killer.  I always found this beer to be better in many ways.  Slightly more flavor, drier than Guinness, and has more alcohol.Pint can, widget, pours exactly like a guiness! Tastes very much like a guiness with a slight aley taste!Not much aroma, pours jet black with a typical nitro head. Some roasted and chocolatey flavors, and somewhat thin mouth feel. Good, but not as good as Murphys or Guinness.pretty good stout in my opinion better then the guen. but thats just me . i think it leave a nicer aftertaste then guen. but a very nice beer.Very similar in taste to Guinness, but lacks the same chewy character. Also didn\\'t get as much aroma. Bitter throughout, with a burnt coffee and chocolate finish.I like this stuff. Sample was canned.\\tFrothy off-white head that stays the course. Body is black, with aromas of espresso and a hint of sweetness. Taste is subtle and sweet....probably sweeter than I expected. A decent Irish Stout indeed.Much too light for my tasteNice, thick creamy head full of tiny bubbles emerges from the can atop a black body. Smooth and roasted flavor typical of dry stout and especially nitro poured stout. Lingering malty but bitter finish. A nice change to the Guinness barrage in Irish pubs.NIce & black with a foamy white head. Roasted coffee flavor, crisp tasting stout. Best enjoyed ice-cold,Nitro can. Pours black with a creamy beigh head. Aroma of roasted malts, chocolate and faint coffee. Flavor is dark roasted malts, mild coffee and a touch of chocolate with a smooth and velvety mouthfeel and has a slightly dry and bitter finish.Dark brown body with a creamy tan head. Not much in the aroma, just hints of some smoke. Some roasted malts and coffee hints in the flavor. Palate was watery and thin!Black color; White head, gee f-ing surprise!; No aroma. BLAND, even blander then Guinness. They must have worked really hard to get a beer this bland. The worst stout that has ever passed my lips!Draft at McBrides Irish Pub, Paris. Hard not to compare this to Guinness (so here goes): Black with thick creamy brown/beige head. Nice! - Looks like Guinness. Burnt/roasted coffee in the aroma. Not so strong (otherwise it would have scored higher). The taste is pretty bitter with a distinct coffee flavour to it. Light acidic. Hops in the aftertaste. (Much) better than Guinness. Good palate, but feels a bit tame. Needs a bit of bite to be perfect (like Guinness).Chocolate malty aroma. Appearance is black with off white head. Chocolate, caramel, dark toffee and some coffee flavors. Palate is very creamy and smooth. Solid.Well, Im in Baltinglass and his is here.  It a dry nitro stout, nothing to see here.  Weak roast flavour, and extra cold.A sweet aroma, pours the usual black stout.  Head is weaker than many other stouts.  Tastes of coffee and a bit of a syrupy sweetness.  Really good beer, but nothing notably different than the much easier to find Guinness.Great stout, but not as good as GuinnessUPDATED: FEB 23, 2006 Sweet smells of chocolate.  Light, but thick head.  Decent lacing.  Smooth flavor, still a little watery for my likes in Stouts.  Quite  mellow.  I enjoyed this much.Nice roasted malt taste. Full body. Maybe some coffee hints.Very thick whit3 headStill has a way to go to surpass the experience that is a Guinness.Draft in Cork.  Although very comparable in aroma and appearance, slightly thinner and less full flavor compared to Murphys or Guinness.  Still nice though.Can.  Brown/black body, with medium build, and creamy head.  Aroma is slight chocolate.  THe flavor is weak coffee, with little malt and slightly sweet and dry.  Weaker than guinnessBottle. Looks great, smells great, tastes, um, so-so. Pours with a decent head that lingers, as youd expect with an Irish stout. Fantastic aroma: chocolate, toasted cereal. Palate: suprisingly light body for a stout, with an ultra-dry finish.  Lingering chocolate notes but the dominant flavour is ashes.UPDATED: OCT 29, 2006 Canette de 500 ml (qui tait disponible en Ontario). Noir typique, bon collet. Arome de malte roti ass bien. Got de malte chocolat mi amre. Un peu mieu que Guinness.A very drinkable stout.Did they change this stuff before bringing it back to the states? I am catching slight wiffs of smoke as the aroma hits my nose just before a sip....not Schlenkerla burned down house smoke, not even Stone smoked Porter....more of a VERY subtle scots whisky malt with peat smoke. Big coffee, bitter chocolate and dark pumpernickel toast. If you are sick of the same old Big G and dont want to go with a big heavy imperial, give the new import batch a try.50 cl can. Very smooth and easy-drinking, but with no character whatsoever. An alternative to lager on a hot day, perhaps, but a very boring beer.UPDATED: JUN 11, 2004 Much better than I gave it credit for originally. Nice opaque color with slightly off-white head. Nice and thick on the palate with roasted coffe and chocolate overtones. Great for a slap on the arse!Pours black with nice thick tan head.  Taste is like a better boddingtons and more full bodied.  Malts and chocalate and almost tea and milk like.  Very irish flavor and a great brew.Dark brown to black pour with creamy beige head.  Roasted malt aroma and slightly burnt flavor.  A pretty nice stout, but nothing exceptional.UPDATED: JAN 16, 2004 Matched against the Murphy\\'s, this is darker in the head and the body.  The mouthfeel is just creamy, with no real oily characteristic.  I prefer the flavor of this to the Murphy\\'s when done side-by-side.  The flavors are less subdued, and this just fills the mouth better.  Not my favorite stout style, but this seems to be pretty good.Tap. Dark pour, standard nitro.  Coffe and hops on the nose, light body.  Strange feel to this, I couldnt quite feel it out, but it didnt really strike me as very stout like.  Nontheless a chuggable brew.jet black nitrogen foam makes it a pretty beer.  not a very firm stout that is medium bodied and creamy; it is a bit lacking in the malt profile and complexity.  though this is common among these low alcohol level ales.A nitro-can, poured into a wide-mouthed glass. Virtually black in color, with a beautiful, fine, sturdy tan head. Aromas: soft, sly hints of cocoa, coffee, and nuts. Dry, yet a touch on the sweet side. Some initial bitterness and grit on the palate --does it come from the can? I cant shake a certain metallic tinge. No, it continues throughout the finish. The brief and uneventful finish, if I may say. Not as creamy as the nitro-Guinness Draught, but nowhere near as full-bodied and full of character as the best stouts in the world. Very forgettable. Pass me the darts, mate.Nice and black, with a head that wouldn\\'t go away.  A bit thin and watery for a stout, but all together not horrible.  But there are much better stouts to drink.Very strong tasting full roasty flavour. Maybe a little overpowering but not unpleasant. I can imagine this to be a lot improved if enjoyed poured from a tap and not a can. texture wasnt bad however. Will have again.UPDATED: APR 12, 2009 One thing about these Irish Dry Stouts that I can live without is how they explode when you open them. Pours a thick chocolate-milk-like substance with a nice small head. All cream at first, then waning to its final resting appearance. Aroma is only slightly malty and chocolatey. I can smell the can too, just like Guinness. Flavor is again very much like Guinness; I dont think I can tell the difference. A year ago I wouldve thought this was bold. Since then I discovered imperial stouts, and these are just a real let down nowadays. Overrated, simply put. Overall, fair.Its as beautiful to pour as a Guinness, seeing the liquid mix within itself can bring a man to tears. The beer doesnt match the beauty of the pour. It does have a slight smoked flavor to it.(canned) Black with a thick, creamy head. Nose of coffee with some distinct sweetness. Taste is very smooth. Chocolate, coffee with some sweetness in the background (vanilla and caramel). Well balanced. Slightly bitter finish with some dryiness.Slightly weaker than Guinness - sort of as if you mixed Guinness and Murphy.  Comparisons aside, a very worthy beer.Very dark reddish brown with a big beige head. Aroma is roasted malt, coffee and smoke. Flavor is medium sweet and moderate bitter. Dry and moderate bitter finish. Very good for the low ABV. 210811Pours virtually black with a thick, creamy, tan head that lasts forever (all stouts here in Dublin are pretty much indistinguishable in appearance alone). The aroma is light with some hops and roasted grains. The flavor is lighter than some other stouts - a touch more malt and yeast flavor (though it is certainly not sweet tasting from the malt) and less roasty and coffee-like. It finishes dry with tastes of yeast and hops. The after-taste has some notes of coffee. Overall, not bad but not as good as the other stouts Ive tried here (Guinness, Guinness North Star Brew, Murphys Stout, and Messrs. Maguire Plain).\"thanks to eagle for grabbing this one for me. The pour was perfect jut like Guinness. Huge thick creamy head that laced just like it should. Aroma was of roasted coffee and some smokey aroma. Flavor was much the same. Mouthfeel was thiner then i expected after looking at the pour. Other then that this is a great beer. Sorry their time ran up.\"Even though there was a hint of roasted malts and chocolate it seemed that this beer fell short of what an Irish stout should taste like.  It did improve as it warmed but still there are better stouts out there.I like this, but am I the only one who can taste the aluminum at the end?  MJ says this is one of the 500 great beers.  I think just because its possible to serve this otherwise excellent stout in a can with a nitro cannister doesnt mean you should.UPDATED: AUG 25, 2008 500 mL can:  We just lost good old Beamer in Canada as well due to multinational business issues.  No where near as bitter in the fnish as Guinness and way more flavour than Murphys.  Mild  hints of oatmeal, caramel, molasses  with bigger notes of coffee.  MiIld but great frothy flavours, which slightly heighten as it warms.  Hard to find a stout this versatile.  Anybody I give a can to, cant believe how light it is.  It is crazy how this beer can have so much flavour and yet so few calories and alcohol.  What a treasure this stout is.Nitrogen pint can into a glass.  About what youd expect for a draught Irish stout... this beer was one of the first my fiancee ever liked and got her into beer - notably stouts!on tap Pours almost black with typical, though modest tan nitro head. Nose of roasted malt. Flavours of coffee, roasted malt, and bitter chocolate. Creamy mouthfeel with slightly bitter malty finishOn tap at Santorini Taverna and Grill in Eden Prairie, MN. Pitch black in color. Not much aroma. Very smooth and creamy with hints of roast malt and coffee, but overall not much taste at all. Similiar to Guiness. Perhaps served too cold.Dark creamy head. Smokey choclate aroma, lightly sweet flavor. A touch of bitter choclate in the finish. An very good stout I would drink again and again(BJCP Class)  A good Irish stout but this was not the other stout I will not mention.  This seemed to be lacking some character and a little flavor.  A medium feel to this beer and a very light flavor.  Smooth no hops, good head a nice clean beer.  Slight smokiness to the beer.  It was just missing some good stout qualities like a deep flavor and a rich overall nose to the beer.Apparently, Irish stouts are supposed to be flat? Its the widgit thing that ruins this for me. The flatness even deadens the aroma. I just drank two 15 oz cans, and I still feel like I havent really had a beer. Theres just something about these attempts at \"genuine\" Irish stout that leave me wanting.People have referred this beer to me as \"Guinness light.\" I definitely prefer Guinness, now that Ive tasted Beamish. They both have that similar, creamy mouthfeel and semibitter finish. What turned me off to this, however, was the taste, which was too \"roasty,\" almost overdone.Nitro draught can.  Opaque black with a creamy tan head, which is well retained.  Bittersweet chocolate aroma.  Flavor is high in astringent tannic bitterness.  Bittersweet chocolate and some fruitiness seem to be lurking in the background, but they are masked by the ever present astringency.  Somewhat thin mouth feel, dry finish.Tapped. Black opaque, huge brown foamy head. Sweet barlic aroma with hints of plastic/soap. Lovely palate, taste of barley and a bit smoke. Semi-bitter aftertaste. Soft and good.Pours almost black with typical, though modest tan nitro head. Nose of roasted malt. Flavours of coffee, roasted malt, and bitter chocolate. Creamy mouthfeel with slightly bitter malty finish.Tap:  basic nitro pour with the standard ultra dense tan head.  Not all that much to the nose.  If anything, it was just a bit more fruity than other Irish dry stouts Ive had.  Softer flavors, without as much astringent roastiness and a little more fruitiness.  Ghosty finish, echoing a roasted malt flavor.  Pleasant.(Draught in Dublin on 2008-07-01) Black. Dense lightly tan-coloured medium-sized head. Roasted malts in nose. Medium and dryish palate with some carbonation. Quite bit roasted malts, some coffee and some nuts in taste. Slightly creamy. Quite ok.Pours the most beautiful cascading tan foam that turns into a wonderful and long lasting head -- a wonderful full black stout beneath. The aroma is of roasted malts ? very earthy. The taste is smooth with a slight bite at the end, but nothing very distinguishable. In short, the appearance was great, but the flavor was very bland.50cl can. A good looking stout with a perfect creamy, light brown head. Surprisingly little aroma, just a hint of roasted/burnt malt. Theres also some kind of a smell that brings my mind on something sweet, maybe toffee? The body is also surprisingly light with almost watery texture. The carbonation is quite lively and a short but distinct bitter finish.drink on tap\\tAroma:Light cofee\\tAppearance:Dark black big creamy head\\tFlavor:Cofee and cream,Small torefaction.Draught can.  Light coffee/chocolate nose.  A bit tinny.  Pretty nitro head.  Flavor is deadened milky chocolate, almost burnt malt.  Body is both watery and creamy (?!?)On tap: Nearly opaque hue with a solid creamy tan head and excellent lacing. Aroma has a tone of coffee, semi-sweet chocolate, roasted malt, earthy yeast, and bitter hops. I found that this is a very dry and clean tasting stout, watery and soft mouthfeel, medium-bodied. Smoother than Guinness and less chocolate taste than Murphy\\'s, but gets old after a while. Recommended on tap, okay in bottle, avoid the can.a little less body than guinness. Not as bitter either, but it is really smooth.UPDATED: OCT 30, 2003 From 500ml widget can into a Bass glass. Black nitro body. Lots of action with the bubbles that don\\'t know where to go at first, but it rapidly calms down and become mysterious and stable after a minute. Big tiny bubble beige head, eternal and great stickiness. Shy aroma of roasted malt and milk. Light creamy body, texture reminding of vanilla coke, notes of coffee. Very light. Decent, but I can have St-Ambroise oatmeal stout without needing to drive to Ontario.Definitley a bit better than Guinness, just a bit, alos, another cool \"widget\" can, the foam ain\\'t as cool as Guinness, but the taste is slighty better, maybe it\\'s the after-taste, Beamish has more...which is good.Bottled. Black with deep red tints, good rocky beige head and good condition. Peppery chocolate and roast barley aromas, Chocolate powder in the mouth with a slight milky lactic note and a sweet finish that becomes chalky dry. Prefer this to any of the nitrogenated variations of Irish stouts.Doing a 3-way shootout with Guinness, Murphys, & Beamish tonight.  Lets see who comes out on top.\\t16oz nitro widget can.  No freshness date.\\tPours black with a one-finger+ dense nitro light brown head.  Light brown and ruby highlights under light.  Comes in middle of the pack in darkness of the head and body, leaves good lacing, head retains well but falls apart a bit at the end.  More similarities to Murphys rather than Guinness in the appearance (and really all categories for that matter).\\tAroma is pretty quiet but does feature some sweet malt, roast, chocolate, touch of coffee.  That nitro \"smell\" is present.  Middle of the pack in aroma.\\tFlavor is quite nice, light milk chocolate, coffee, roasted malts, very smooth.  Equal to Guinness, although different.  A bit sweeter and roastier.\\tMouthfeel is amazing...I love nitro beers.  Incredibly smooth and drinkable.  Fuller body than Guinness, identical to Murphys.\\tA close 2nd in this shootout.  Similar but superior to Murphys.  Subtle differences between this and Guinness and they are both quite good.  Guinness gets a SLIGHT nod due to better appearance and aroma, availability and price also help the classic from St. James Gate take the victory in the shootout.  Still, very glad to FINALLY be able to try Beamish after years of hunting, a solid silver medal winner in my book!UPDATED: NOV 6, 2005 (on tap) Dark, almost black colour with a nice small but stable creamy beige head. Not much aroma except a touch of roasted malts. Nutty roastmalty taste with dark chocolate and a dry and bitter finish. Not bad at all but way too light bodied Stout.Very dark almost black color with a thich greyish head. The taste is malty with notes of smoke. Finishes slightly bitter but mild and very pleasantBrownish, some white head. Creamy a bit chocolaty and not to bitter. Beamish made no special impression on me. Slightly above average.Big points for appearance here.  Nice solid blackish color with a medium, creamy head.  Aroma of malt, chocoff, slight licorice.  Tastes malty, with a hit of chocoff.  Palate is medium (yes, it is somewhat watery but I didnt find it a deductable wateryness).  Finishes dry with more chocoff.On tap-Old Chicago-Rockford,IL-This was the last brew i had to finish the St. Patrick\\'s day tour and get the shirt.  This brew tastes just like Guinness, but with more roasty flavorWhile this one is pleasant enough it falls far short of what makes me take notice in a stout. Roasted malts and coffee aroma and then a creamy enough dry follow-up. Nice.Pours thick, blackish body, very satisfying, taste like coffee, really smoothe.  good beer to relax to.Can w/ widget: Pours deep black-brown with a great tight beige-brown head. Nice sweet chocolate aroma with hints of burnt grain and coffee. Nice malty flavour with a good kick of bitterness and a smokey/burnt aftertaste. Very smooth and great body if drinking through the head.Tap @ Tuomari, Kuopio. Rated @ 21.3.2009.\\tPours a black colour with a beautiful creamy, slightly off-white head. Aroma of roasted malts and smoke. Flavour of roasted malts, coffee and chocolate. Pleasant taste. Medium bodied with watery mouthfeel. As good as Guinness Draught.Black/brown with a creamy, smooth head. The aroma has notes of roasted malt, licorice and caramel, and my thought quickly are directed towards a Guinness, and even more so after I taste it. Its smooth and creamy with notes of roasted malt, licorice, caramel and a light bitterness. Its a really OK stout for session drinking. 1952Draught at lbaren, Copenhagen. Totally black beer with a nice creamy head. Beautiful!! Aroma is weak, I only sense some roasted malt. Flavor is bitter hoppy and malty with chocolate notes but with a somewhat sickly indefinable touch.... Not my kind of stout!Canned.  Black colour. Light brown and creamy head. The aroma had  a hint of toffee.Creamy thin and light roasted flavourdraught. brown color. high white head. thin and flavuorless. very watery like the guinness draught.500 ml nitro can.  Dark black colour but quite transparent with a thick light tan head.  Aroma is surprisingly robust, light milk chocolate with a touch of malted milk and coffee.  Flavour shows lots of coffee and roasted barley.  Dry bitter, roasty finish.  Thin body.  Pretty good.This was tasted along with a couple of Youngs Stouts and it was the weakest of the all. It pours great and has a rich creamy feel, but it is lacking something for a stout. It is the best \"Can\" stout that I have tried, but it still is a little lite on taste.Great stout...better than Guinness...by far. if u would ever like to try a great stout try this one. u wont regret itDelicious.  Almost a dessert, and drier than a desert.  Sweet, dark, and creamy.  Tried from a nitro can at Dempseys in Lawrence.  (4/3/2008)When I was living in Boston you could get pints of stout for a buck at Dooleys Tavern, if you jammed with the freewheeling sesiun.  Musicians just anted up into a pile on the table and the waitress took what she needed when she handed around pints.  The word on Beamish was that it was lighter than Guinness, so you could keep drinking longer.  I think this is still the case - beamish is more delicate in flavour, but still tasty as hell, and it brings back great memories.Draught at lbaren. Almost black - big thick offwhite head. Classic irich dry stout. Not much of anything, very drinkable, it is mostely at creamy feeling.Nitro can. Pours a deep brown with a great tan head that cascades throughout the glass.  The aroma is faintly of coffee.  The taste is all roasted malts, but with a slightly bitter hoppy finish.  Pretty decent stout, especially out of a can.Typical nitro stout looks.  Falling wash of milk chocolate color settles to black with a creamy beige-white head.  Chocolate, malty aroma, some roast, but nitro ruining creaminess dulls everything.  Taste is creamy but empty, light chocolate, bitter finishing roastiness.TAP: light nose - would have liked more there, though it was pleasant. Opaque dark brown and a tall tan merenge-like head.  Starts clean and subtle, then bursts quickly into a strong roasted coffee-like flavor with an espresso bitterness in the end that lingers on the roof of the mouth long after the swallow. Thin body overall, but a OK balance. Guinness-like in nature, but has some unique qualities.Another great Irish stout, stands proud alongside the likes of Guinness and Murphys.  Seems to be slightly less smooth than Guinness, but other than that has the same creamy qualities as Guinness, with that fantastic bitter, stouty after taste.the widget made a distressed \"dive bombing\" sound when i opened the can.  the beer pours black with a small, yet respectable tan head, strong lacing.  weak aroma of airy chocolate, coffee, licorice.  flavor is coffee and chocolate.  not exactly certain how to sum this up...kinda muted, not complex, not sweet, not bitter...what was the brewer shooting for?500ml can (4.2%) at home.  Accomplished by smoke and noise when opened. Black body colour under a velvet beige head, fully lasting. Discreet chocolate aroma. Malted milk chocolate in flavour complemented by a moderate touch of roasted grain. Semi-dry ending. Medium bodied. On the very smooth side - in fact much too smooth, tending to become characterless (08.06.2007).UPDATED: OCT 30, 2005 Pub Can, October 2005: Mostly opaque jet black with the beautiful characteristic thick tan cream.  Minimal, but sweet malted whiskey barley aroma.  Obviously creamy palate with a subtle oily texture, before it turns dry, dusty and chalky in the finish.  Flavours are like charred biscuits and other slightly roasted nuts.  Not quite my style.\\t\\tHead to head with Murphys Irish Stout (Pub Can), December 2002: : Black, with a bit of ruby.  Smooth roasted aroma. . .creamy nutty flavour, with just hint of coffee.  All together not the full roasted flavour I would like from a stout.  6/4/6/4/14UPDATED: SEP 13, 2006 12 OZ can from Liquid Solutions. Small tan head, beer is almost black. Not much aroma, some mild toffee is all. Very mellow flavor profile. A bit of cream, roasted chocolate and coffee. Thin bodied, watery mouthfeel. Bitter cocoa finish and aftertaste. Basically little to no flavor...Pours brownish-black with a thick tan-off white head (into a Beamish pint glass).  Aroma seems milder than a chocolate stout.  Very creamy mouth feel.  Kind of sweet flavor.  Smooth.  I enjoy this brew.Tap.  Pours a nice light black, a bit darker than guinness, and a creamy tan nitro head.  Aroma is light roasted malts, and some caramel sweetness with a hint of bready yeast.  Flavor is a bit of chocolate, and roast with a sweet middle and a relatively dry and somewhat creamy smooth finish.  Pretty good overall, but nothing great.A good example of an Irish Stout, although I prefer Murphys and even Guinness, depending on how it is served.  Out of the can, this is standard nitrogen stuff, which I recently revisited, and I was surprised how enjoyable it was.  Sweeter and thinner than its counterparts, and most of the flavour profile gets lots in the bubbles; I think it gets higher ratings because people like to say theyve discovered something other than Guinness.  Good though.From can, typical widget pour, deep black with coffee head. Chocolate malt and coffee flavours dominate. Sweeter flavour over all than Guinness and it has a lingering bitter finish. Perhaps a touch thin in body. A nice stout.Poured a dark brown, mahogany color with a small, light tan head that left nice lacing on the glass.  Aroma of chocolate and roasted grains.  Taste of light roast, little to none hop bitterness, and slight metallicness.  A quick drinker with not many distintive tastes.A wonderful Irish stout, characteristic of Guinness, but what Stout isnt compared to Guinness?Pours a deep black with a thick tan head.  Thick and creamy is the name of this beer.  Very drinkable because the taste are pretty subtle.\\t\\t14.9 oz. canThis is REAL good stuff. Thick, creamy, a lot of flavor. Medium to full. A REAL stout.Nitro-canned.  Aroma has chocolate overtones, muddy malt, and touches of smoke and nuts.  Pitch pour with a cream off-beige nitro head - though the overall appearance is a little sterile.  Tastes of smoke and ash, slightly sour with sufficient roast and burnt notes.  Faint nuts.  Smooth light body, just a tick above watery, with a dry, burnt aftertaste.  Dry and surprisingly refreshing!440ml nitro-can from RSVP in Portland.  Pitch-black body with just the slightest hints of ruby-red highlights.  A good inch of off-white solid head that stays very well (thanks to the nitro).  Smells vaguely of chocolate malts.  Tastes sweet and roasty with coffee and chocolate playing big roles.  Only a slight burnt astringency.  Sweet.  Flavors stay on the back of the tongue without the carbonation to wash them off.  Fairly drinkable.  Not bad, fairly similar to (albeit a bit better than) my old favorite Guinness Draught.  Would be much better if carbonated or on cask IMHO...  Still a relatively decent dry stout.(Draught @ ToT 05, Tampere) Very dark brown, almost opaque color with a huge, creamy and lacy, beige head. Very earthy, quite nice and smoky aroma. Dryish, earthy and plesantly smoky flavor. Medium-bodied, dryish and chalky palate. Smooth but slightly thin. A very nice stout for the ABV!It looks good, and it smells good, and it\\'s 90% a Guinness.  I like the bitter finish and the roasted aftertaste, but the more-watery less-creamy palate really hurt this one on the ratings board.Roasted coffee and malts aroma. Mahogany in colour, creamy toffee head.\\t Roasted malts, also coffee and chocolate taste. Creamy and smooth. A treat, lace all over the glass.Canned (0.5 l). Black coloured, brown head. Roasted dry flavour with a bitter roasted finish. A soft smooth stout.(0.4 L from Tap) A good beer. Poured black with an off white head. The first think I tasted was coffee. The toasted malt flavoring fades to a bitter, dry aftertaste. Pretty much what I expected.Draught. Black colour with a nice creamy tan head. Slight roasted malt aroma with a hint of coffee. The flavour is roasted, smoked malt with some coffee. Quite dry and a bit bitter in the finish, very smooth mouthfeel. Not as good as Guinness but quite close to it.Draft. Multiple tastings. (Previous tastings from memory) Drank several pints of these in Ireland and enjoyed every one of them. Very similar to Guinness though I think Guinness still is the better stout overall.From tap at lbaren. Pours dark brown to black with a dense/creamy light tan/off-white head. Roasted malt aroma with a light coffee note. Smooth and almost creamy mouthfeel. Distinct bitter flavour and a light roasted note. Bitter and roasted flavoured finish.Widget can:  Love the look of these beers but they always lack in flavor.  Slight coffee hints, bitter, and smooth dry malts.  Little watery.Sweet and roasty malt aroma. Opaque black body with beautiful cascading white (nitro) head. Smooth and sweet with hints of coffee and a strong finishing roasted malt bitterness. Dry and drinkable. Can.Properly done stout, but no inspiration in it. Its Norman Rockwell when you want Monet. Smooth but lacks richness.Visually stunning.  Motor oil midnight black with a beautiful thick creamy tan head.  A roasted malt/coffee aroma.  Flavored with notes of coffee, chocolate, roasted earthy malt.  Flavor was more muted than I expected. Body was thinner than I thought and the finish was slightly bitter.  Slightly above average as stouts go, but there are better by far.Better than Guinness or Murphys with a more flavorful roasted chocolate taste.  The head also is done to perfection out of a draught can, as it foams up and settles out in a reasonable time frame.Imperial black pint with perfect cream top. I could not get much aroma from this offering--which may have been do more to the smokyish atmosphere--however it had some robust roasted sweetness.  Nice balanced robustness in flavor with a crisp burnt, slightly dry, finish. A fine, smooth, creamy, dry stout.Nice malty quality to this stout.  Firsm roasted flavor asserts itself straight away and then smooth malt takes over and finishes with a little kick of hops a very solid stout.Underrated stout, in Dublin at least. Looks how a dry stout should, exacty like Guinness. Nice chocolatey/coffeeish finish. Probably not as tasty as Guinness but still a great stout and its considerably cheaper than most pints in Ireland.26 Jan 06 - Sweet roasted malt aroma.  Black colour, good manufactured head.  Coffee roasted malt but lacks complexity.  A nice sweet bitter balance. Overall - This beer lacks something.A standard Irish dry stout.  Nothing outstanding above Guiness.  Toasty, smoky in flavor.  Creamy finish.from the tap poured black with a creamy long lasting head. great smokey, chocolatey flavor....with smooth satisfying dry aftertaste.  a great beer!440ml ounce can - $1.99 at Total Wine & More in Kennesaw, Georgia.\\t\\tAppearance: Pours out a deep brown, near black body with a dense, full inch of creamy-looking, ivory-hued head.\\t\\tSmell: Roasty nose with notes of Breakfast Blend coffee, grains, dark baked bread, light chocolate, a few more grains, and, thats about it.\\t\\tTaste: Roasted barley and blackened malt with some touches of chocolate, mild coffee, and toasted grains. Subtle sweetness. As it warms, some caramel tones emerge. No perceived hop flavor here, with most of the modest bitterness coming through from the roasted grains. Finishes dry with a lingering, though slack roasty bitterness and mineral water quality.\\t\\tMouthfeel: Medium-light body. Softly carbonated. Silky mouthfeel.\\t\\tDrinkability: Not bad! A smooth, mild, lightly flavored Irish Stout with a sensible amount of alcohol.Hands down my favorite widely available Irish Stout.  Used to be available locally in can and on tap, but has gone mysteriously missing.   Murphys and Guinness just dont compare.Pours a beautiful deep black with a thick creamy everlasting head and nice lacing. Aroma is black coffee and roasted malts. Roasted malty and bitter taste. Creamy bitter palate. Very nice stout.draught can.  Pitch black with a nice irish stout can.  Very comparable to guinness.  It is a little more bitter, but still very smooth and drinkable.Can 2002-10-12, Sweden\\tCreamy and nice stout! I guess that it would have recived higher scores as a draft version....A black, dry, roasty, toasty stout.  Its good, but Guinness still has it beat.Roasted coffee with a grainy edge.  A mild body and low bitterness make this light and drinkable.  I still dont like nitro dispensed beers in can or on draft, but this is still a good session beer and a bit more interesting than the dominant Guinnesspours creamy brown with creamy head\\tsmells of light coffee and roasted grain\\ttastes of toffee, roasted coffee beans, hearty grain, buscuit.\\tSlightly sweet.\\tit handles the nitro well.UPDATED: MAY 30, 2005 440ml nitro can - Pours a very deep brown with a nice fluffy offwhite head that laces pretty well.   After letting this one settle I left with the very slight aroma of coffe and cocoa.  Flavor is somewhat dry yet contains some coffee and a nice bitter finish.  Very smooth on the palate.  Yummy but not a great stout in the micro world...I was expecting so much more which I guess explains my low score. I suppose this really isn\\'t swill but it just doesn\\'t live up to the Irish stout moniker. Of course I had the widget can, maybe that\\'s the problem.I had one of these at home on St. Paddys with corned beef and cabbage.  It is very similar to Guinness but a bit more malty.  A fine example of a dry stout.Widget Can: Medium small but long lasting fine bubbled beige head under a nearly opaque red-brown brew. Nice sea surface frothy wash lace. Faint heavily roasted malt and coffee aroma. Coffee becomes more pronounced as it warms. Medium reasonably smooth but soft body. Medium bitter roasted malt and some coffee flavoured start. Middle and finish fade somewhat quickly in intensity compared to  both the Guinness and Murphys.Bottle : Pours black with creamy white head.  Slightly smokey/coffee/chocolate taste with full body.  kinda lie JV guiness0,5l Can. Brown colour. Malty aroma with nice smooth bitterness. A little dry bitter flavours.UPDATED: OCT 8, 2008 Dark color with a creamy tan head that hangs around. Slightly roasted aroma with a smooth but bitter taste. Not Guinness, not even Murphys but still not bad.Good dry stout, less bitter than Guinness and slightly smoother IMHO. But i like em about the same.This stout is outstanding.  The first stout that I tried and was hooked.  The appearance was near perfect and flavor was ultra smooth.  A very drinkable brew.  Usually just a 50cents or so cheaper than Guinness in my area too.Can w/ glass.  December 2005.  Amazing head (no bubbles, just creamy head in which you can deep a spoon and it tastes delicious), near white, very smooth and body is very black. The release of carbonation is very distinct.  Smell: not much smell to it except a slight burnt.  Taste:  Initial taste very burnt, little hoppy, not carbonated.  Definitely more of a burnt barley/malt taste than any nuts or coffee beans.  Then exhale through nose produces some more nutty flavor along with the burnt taste.  Body: watery; very smooth, well balanced.   As you drink down to the bottom of the glass, the creamy head mixes more with the body, producing a creamier, more nutty taste.  Great aftertaste - very creamy, little nutty, though mostly creamy.  Overall: Somewhat disappointed, The nose and upfront taste isnt nearly as good as Anchors Porter, Three Floyds Robert the Bruce, Bells Oberon 7000th Batch.  But Beamish is much more drinkable than the latter two, though Anchors Porter might be better.  Great session brew.Pours a dark brown color with a creamy tan head.  Aroma is light of roasted malts, slight coffee, chocolate, and molasses.  Flavor is also pretty light of some roasted malts, chocolate, and coffee.  Not much carbonation.  Better then other nitro can stouts but not really that great either.Thick black colour, thick head. I hate nitro cans - they sound like they are going to explode or foam everywhere when you open them. Really nice aroma of smooth, round chocolate and coffee. Tastes quite thin, but is fairly roasty and dry with a fair bit of bitterness. Not too bad - certainly far better than Guinness.Thanks to the Scotsman for the gift. Dark pour with thick 2 finger head. Aroma of roasted, chocolate malt. Dry finish. It was ok.Draught at the Wharf Aalborg. Dark with medium brown long lasting head.  Aroma of roasted malts. Taste roasted malt and coffee and some sweetness.Black and creamy. Dry, bitter and very roasty with some coffee aroma.I Like my stouts and this is one of them.  Strong flavor and character all around.I did enjoy this and I continue to be amazed by the draft quality of these beers.  However, I think I still prefer Guinness or Mackeson.Can: I love widget/stout. Poured black with cascading bubbles. Dry roasted flavor and somewhat creamy mouthfeel. Was a bit watery which was the only dissapointment.RE-rate: Prefer it to Guinness. Sweetish malty chocolate and anise aroma and palate, with a slightly dry finish. Lots of flavour, but very thin on body for a stout, highly drinkable, a great session stout, if there ever was one. Nice burnt malt flavour, and a decent amount of coffee bitterness, weak and artificial.Without a doubt one the best stouts in the world... Fullbodied with a tender yet complex taste to it !!!Dry roasted malt aroma on the creamy, thick tan nitrogen head.  I swear nitrogen carbonation contributes to a particular aroma found in all of these beers...but I digress.  The beer is very dark, but the body is surprisingly (well, probably not all that surprisingly) thin.  Roasted flavors, some chocolate, even a bit of sweetness to counter the overall bitter feel.  Eminently quaffable, distressingly conformist.First, I must admit that I find the cascading ripples of this Beamish to be more beautiful than that of the more highly rated Guinness. I only hope the rest of the beer can measure up! The aroma is a little weak, in my opinion...seems to need more \"umph.\" The flavor is nice, and a bit different from that Guinness standard. A good dry and fairly available. No reason to complain here!Nice dark stout in a pint glass.  Not much of an aroma.  A light watery tasteing beer, for a stout.  A nice finish of a malty falvor though.Almost no aroma.  Roasty and watery taste.  Some metallic.\\tCoffee notes.\\tFull body.\\tDry, bitter flavor.  No hop aroma or flavor.Ruby black color with a light tan, tight, typical hand pump head.  Light coffee and roasted barley aromas.  Slightly thin in feel.  Dark chocolate and coffee flavors.  Dry finish.  Mid-echelon dry stout.20oz draught can.  Pretty much the same as Guinness Draught.  Although there is the slightest bit more flavor in the Beamish when compared to Guinness draught.  Smooth, drinkable, and fun to look at.A very classic Irish Stout. Massively creamy head on a pitch black body. Very typical roasted malt profile here - some espresso and watery smokiness. The body is lost due to traditional nitro tapping, but there is a disinctive flavor here that is nice but barely not a Guiness.  Maintains its creaminess through the beer, but again, there just isnt enough flavor here.Can from Nugget Market in Davis, CA.  This brew is very similar to Guiness Draught, but had a bit more creaminess and depth.  Nice little beer.Solid performer as far as Irish stouts go.Almost black with a small, creamy, tan head. Healthy amount of coffee and roasted malts in the aroma. Delicious bitterness with a hint of dark chocolate under coffee in flavor. Creamy mouthfeel and a nice, lingering finish. Il gladly try this again via can or bottle when I find it.\\t\\t<font size=-4>On tap at <a href=http://www.renfair.com/bristol/index.php>< Rennaisance Faire<font size=-1>Smokey malt hop aroma. Black colour with creamy head and good lacing. Bitter brunt malt flavour. Smooth palate.Only had it once, too bad its so hard to find around here.\\tRe-rate: It holds up well; not much in the way of head but a great taste.From a can.  Dark brown with thin tan head.  Aroma of roasted malts and coffee.  Smooth, but very watery with a bad bitter aftertaste.  Pretty much bottom of the barrel as far as stouts go.Black, frothy head, very smooth, a tad sweeter than Guinness (apologies for the comparison), but not as full. A great beer in its own right.UPDATED: SEP 9, 2005 Draft - dark color, with thick tan head.  Very creamy palate, aroma of chocolate and coffee, An average stout, but that flanks mosts beers.\\t\\tUpdating rating - just had out of nitro can.  I must say I was more impressed than the draft from a bar.  Had a tri-color thing going when it poured - started out looking like a chocolate shake.  Ended up black with a thick long-lasting head.  Had a dry hoppy finish.The Irish tax their beer by alcohol content, which accounts for the low alcohol content of their beer--and the character of the dry stout style.  Still, even the best--and Beamish is the best--is just a little thin.  Still, working with so little, Beamish accomplishes the miraculous; a truly creamy ale, rich and balanced, with a nice finish.  (Maybe the perfect session, though.)Dark blackish hue.  Thick white foamy head.  Roasted malts in the aroma.  Sweet dark chocolate, and coffee; light carbonation, light bodied, velvety smooth with a nice crisp bitter finish.  Nicely balanced, very quafable, dry stout.  I also definately enjoy this brew much better on tap.UPDATED: DEC 6, 2005 Out of can with nitrogen widget.  On par with Guinness.  Not a lot of body, less chocolatey, but better finish.  Not very complex, but still tasty and easy to drink/ find.  Widget makes beer nicely creamy.Often forgotten (even in Ireland) because of the other 2, \\tbut this is a fine stout.Nice deep mahogany with a beige head, vague coffee smell, great silky mouthfeel, not quite as good as guinness.So smoothe and creamy.  I named my car after it. :)UPDATED: MAY 17, 2003 Canned:The smell is very nice, alot of cappucino and malt.It is black as tar and is very thick. Tastes very nice, it is less bitter than Guinness. Bitter chocolate and hops in the end, the aftertaste in quite nice. Fine stout.The ugly step child of the fav beer of the Irish.  Not quite as good as the Guinness- and I think that says enough, dont ya think?Dark dark appearance, beautiful head, thick and creamy. But disapointingly the beer was thin and watery, very flat and almost no body considering this being a dark stout. I had the canned beer. Alcohol content 4.3%.Not as full bodied as some.(Draught)  Pours a very dark brown (almost black) with a thick creamy off-white head.  Roasted malt and nuts flavor and aroma.  Bitter, dry palate.Black with reddish starbursts and has a molasses and caramel nose with a thick, creamy head. While there are subdued roasted notes, sweetness overrides. This is by far the sweetest of the big three Irish stouts.On nitro draft, served in a shaker glass. Dark brown body topped by creamy, everlasting nitro head. Smell was very muted thanks to the nitro and the fact that teh beer was tapped super cold. At first the taste was very watery but by mid-glass when it started to warm up some nice mellow roastedness came out, a bit of dark chocolate. Mouthfeel is smooth and creamy. I liked it but it would no doubt be better if it wasnt served on nitro at 40 degrees Fahrenheit.Looks like a stout should... held up to the light it has a nice brownish-burgundy hue. Bit of a sweet aroma, some burnt aromas. Pleasant bitter flavours. Coffee flavours, a bit of a tinny taste as well, could have been the nitro-can though.Can- This stout was very disapointing. Just as crappy or crappier than the guinness draught I had just had.\\tI do not recomend this.What could I possible say about this beer that hasnt already been written 200 times.  The one I am drinking right now didnt have nearly as big a head as the beer in the picture.  The beer in the picture looks more inviting.  Granted, I did pour mine from a can.  I bet a glass off the tap would be foamier.  This beer is smoother and less bitter then Guiness, which is good.  But it doesnt have the great complex aftertaste of a Murphys.  I therefore rate it somewhere between the two.  A truly excellent beer, and very, very drinkable.  It is not Murphys, but pretty darn good none the less.  Cheers.Lighter body than its cousines but a great beer none the less.  Terriffic on tap.Not to enthused about this one. NItrogen can leaves thick foam on top. Beer is dark brown. Taste is sugary sweet and a very slight roasted malt to it. Overall tasted a bit to artifical for me.Black pour with a large brown head. Creamy aroma of chocolate, vanilla and some coffee. Medium to heavy body and very creamy. Flavor is mostly chocolate with some roasted malts and coffee at the finish. Very good.UPDATED: JAN 14, 2010 (Can). Black color.  Medium off white, creamy \"rolling\" head. Light roasted coffee/malt aroma. Moderate roasted coffee flavor. Avg duration. Smooth finish. Creamy texture. Moderate carbonation. Good lacing.UPDATED: NOV 22, 2004 Excellent foam; dense and smooth, of long persistence. Soft body but from the determined character. Moderately bitter with aroma as soon as toasted.Appearance:  nice thick solid head atop an opaque body that seems rather thinnish when pouring.  Nose:  kind of weak, but nice smokiness, chocolate are noticeable.  Flavor:  dry, slightly smoky, bit of sugar and chocolate; nice but not distinctive.  Rather thin in the mouth and a bit harsh going down.  Certainly palatable, but Guinness and many others are better.  (nitro can version)Guiness-like pour with a similar aroma.  Light taste thats pleasant, but not quite \"stout\" enough.  Sweet malt taste and very sessionable.  I have to give them a decent rating since my great-great grandparents came from County Cork back in the day.  Overall, rather enjoyable.Nice head. Creamy and smoother than a guiness as far as stouts go.  Isnt as bitter as a guiness and malty and dry.A friend of mine (who mercifully isn\\'t going to see this rating) gave me a couple of these. Were I not broke, I would probably have refused; I am not very fond of pseudo-draft cans. So last night I put on a nice CD of West African highlife (I can\\'t stand Irish music lately, and they drink lots of stout in West Africa) and opened one, pouring the contents into a dimpled pint mug. When it settled, the beer was dark brown, and indecisive as to whether or not it wanted to be opaque. the head was beige, and had the knife-and-fork consistency of a nitro stout head. Unfortunately, the beer was surprisingly light-bodied. The flavor had fairly normal roastiness and hoppiness, as did the aroma; both roast and hops contributed their own bitternesses, which was nice. There was an interesting sour hint which makes me want to try this in a nitrogen-free form at some point... Not awful, but I probably won\\'t seek this out. (note: I\\'ve decided to stop trying to be tersely technical in my ratings, if I\\'m not rating very often I may as well unlock the word-hoard.)Black with a tall tan creamy head.  Slight musty and bitter smell with dark chocolate notes.  Bitter flavor with oak and chocolate notes.  Dark and creamy palate.0,5 l can as a gift.\\tClear poured, deep brown beer with a nice creamy tan/beige head. Aroma of light espresso, roasted grains, some brown sugar, mild chocolate, some fruits like plum. Medium bodied beer with caramel and toffee, dry roasted barley and some dark chocolate, nice hops in the finish. Dry aftertaste. Could it slip a lot...Dublin, Ireland\\tOn tap\\tDry and coffee like. However smotth and with a nice palatea little trying to rate especially for a hop head. the beer is full of flavors- burnt coffee & chocolate. it also has a nice little  hop tingling  profile. there is a nice dry bitterness that lingers well. the beer is a little light in texture something like milky. all in all not a bad stout. corned beef sandwich (no rye) with extra coarse mustard. a good eatin beer. i have also gotten a touch of leather.Can:\\tLight beige pretty vast foamy head.\\tPours a dark to almost black beer.\\tSmell some roasted ingredients, hints of coffee and chocolate.\\tTaste is pretty soft and creamy with hints of roasted malts, coffee and slighter hint of soft chocolate, sweets and some hops/bitter.\\tNot bad at all with low carbonation, but maybe a bit too sweet.a silky pour, a glass of umber-edged darkness; microscopic tiny bubbles make a foam as thick as grueyere cream.  very toasty aroma, with hints of something between dark chocolate and licorice, tho very dry and not at all fruity.  the palate too is creamy smooth, perhaps overly smooth.  thin bodied, almost watery; slight bitter finish. fun, but more show than go. gimme a rogue shakespeare!Huge head that quickly dissipates. The beer has a medium body with a mild roasted malt flavor.  A bit of coffee in the aftertaste.Nitro tap at Ballydoyle, Downers Grove. Not a lot of actual Irish stouts actually get over to these shores (dunno if this is actually made in Canada for US consumption). But, first off, my experience with this beer is enhanced by the fact that they know how to pour pint here. Starts out with a cascade of bubbles making the glass look brown, then settles to solid black with a brown, creamy head up top; the standard for a stout. Im not catching a lot of aroma in this weather, but I can say its a fine, light malt with a slight note of chocolate, but no off notes from roasted barley. Taste is definitely distinguishable from Guinness, less sour, drier, and just a little bit smoother. Again, not too bitter or astringent, just a fine stout as practiced by the brewer for many years.keg at One pint Helsinki 0,5l 5,9\\tcolor: black nice thick head and lace\\tTaste:solid stout roasted malts,chocolate and dryish.Guite nice lasting aftertaste as well. I tasted it first time 1995 at Dublin and liked it more than my previous favorite Guinness. Maybe my memories about it is bit sweeter.Pours dark reddish brown with a creamy head. Couldnt get much aroma, but I my nose was congested so that doesnt mean much. Coffee and almost a burnt flavor. Stronger flavor and much thicker than Guinness, but overall pretty similar. I like it better than Guinness.the stout is indeed better than the red ale.  its pretty standard for a stout.  and its better than the overrated guinness society tries to put in your hand.This is a terrific dry irish stout like guiness.  It has the lightness of guiness, with a more full rounded nutty flavour and less of the bitter roasted malt finish.Poured from 440ml nitro can into pint mug. Black with persistent 1 finger creamy head which leaves nice lacing on glass. Aromas of dark malt with notes of chocolate and coffee. Tastes of roasted and chocolate malts with a hint of coffee on the finish. Mouthfeel is silky, which is typical for any nitro dispensed ale. This is definitely a session beer.Beautiful pour: Dark brown with a creamy brown head that lasts and lasts. Smells like chocolate milk. Chocolate & toffee flavor with a [surprisingly] thin mouth feel. A nice bitter aftertaste is another surprise. Wonderful! Just wonderful!50cl can, shared at a tasting, thanks Eyal for this one, pours and hazy brown with a thick head, aroma of chocolate, carob, nuts and high sweet tones, flavor is dry with bitter chocolate, cocoa, green herbs, bitter finish with medium body, niceOn Tap: Felt I had to have it on tap since it willl no longer be distributed in the US by Newcastle.  The beer is solid, although not outstanding.  It will be missed simply because it was so widely availible.  The beer itself pours a deep brown color, almost like a thick nut brown, almost looks thinner than most stouts.  The aroma is of raisins/prunes up front with hints of coffee, chocolate, caramel, smoke, and malts.  The flavors are muchthe same as the aromas.Poured dark brown/black, creamy, smooth, simple, roasted malts, little chocolate, slight coffee.pours black with creamy white head,nice looking beer.nice roasty malt/hop aroma.creamy head turns into watery mouthfell..this is normal for the style,very drinkable,nice burnt toast noteslight bitterness on back of tounge,very enjoyable.Can.

Oily palate.i love stouts and this is probably my favorite, it just has more flavor that guinness, although it may not be as smooth, granted it doesnt have a bite either.  gives a nice nutty coffee flavor with a thick white head to dip your nose in, its just good stuffUPDATED: DEC 14, 2005 Rerate Not bad - just does not rate a 4.0. Same description. Original 4.0 On tap - beautiful pour - rates a 5 in my book any day.  Nice black as night appearance. Coffee undertones, just the right amount of bitterness.  No real discernible aroma.  Strong finish.  On par with Guinness in my opinion.Nitro can. Pours thick black with creamy mid-size head; great stout look. Wonderful on the palata, creamy, slightly bitter; roasty cocoa notes. A bit dry in finish, not as rich and heavy as Guinness, but still a great choice. Splendid!Nice loooking cascade effect out of the nitro-can  deep deep black with a great tan head.\\tA malty/burnt oat aroma..its better than Guiness.\\tCleaner and crisper  and no discernable hopping.\\tVery smooth and easy on the tongue..a most quaffable Irish stout.Not as nice as Murhpys and on a par with Guinness. This is very good stout, especially from the tap in the Emerald Isle.I was surprised that I liked this, but I did.  Nice and stouty and if comparing it to Guinness drier, so good in my eyes (and moutH).UPDATED: NOV 23, 2006 March, 2006 Finbarrs can, from Aldi.  Soft, roasty, dry and bitter. Lacks the wine notes and touch of sour acidity of Guinness. Dry bitterness in the finish is interesting, though can be a tad too heavy. [2.7]\\tNov, 2006. Nitro keg, Less III Maillets, Armien, France.  Lots of nitro and served very cold. Thin and acidic -  quite stale. [0.7]See rating for guinness and murphys.  Nice coffee and some smoked tones.  These dry stouts are always very refreshing cos they are fairly watery.  I still dont like the low ABV.  Not really worthy of the name stout.Pours black with a tan head. This is kind of lame. Some roasty aroma. Maybe some weak chocolate and coffee in the flavor. I guess it has more flavor than guinness.UPDATED: JUL 10, 2003 Not as bitter as Guinness.  And much better. My favorite Irish StoutCan. Poured a black color with a creamy tan head. This was brought on by the widget that makes the creamy head in the can. Aroma was very dark, roasted malts, coffee, and smoke. Flavor was some roasted bitters, coffee, and smoke flavors. Very heavy, dark beer. Very rich and creamy. One of the better beers for the style, and what it is.Nitro can. Typical nitro draught pour. Light toasted malt aroma. Perhaps a touch of smoke. Very dark brown color with ruby tint at the edges (takes a strong light). Good tan head. A bit thinner than medium bodied. Creamy nitrogenation. The flavor is burnt toast, but in a smooth way, and there is some definite bitter along the edges of the tongue. I vote for some hop, but it could be the burnt aspect. Smooth and good. A soothing stout.Location: 440 ml nitro can from Gillys, 7/25/09\\t\\t\\tAroma: Roasted malts, chocolate, coffee\\t\\tAppearance: Black color, about an inch and a half of brownish tan head, thick lacing on the glass\\t\\tFlavor: Roasted malts with a decent amount of hops in the finish\\t\\tPalate: Very creamy and smooth, no noticeable carbonation, a bit thin\\t\\tOverall Impression: \\tThis was a pretty tasty dry stout, not a great one, but nice enough, certainly drinkable, and a very nice looking beer.Very dark, but very drinkable. Truly a stout in the Guinness vein, but with its own distinct flavor. A nice, light, chocolatey brew with an after taste reminiscent of good espresso. A most try for any stout fan.Nitro Tin. Pasteurised hoppy aroma. Poured black with tan head, much lacing.  Malty flavour with a little bitterness. Lasting espresso bitterseeet finish.  This as a workaday stout, light enough to be a session stout.NITRO CAN...  \\tThus the taste was a one dimensional roast. Fake creamy head.  A little bit of sweetness that brings a tropical stout to mind.Pours very dark looks black but has some ruby tint when held up to a light. Good Tight white head.

Very much like boodingtons.  Slight roast taste.Im not much on stouts that offer as much aftertaste as this.  It isnt bad, but Ive had better. :)DraughtDark, creamy head. Light roasted malt nose. Good body, smooth, with a very good balance of malt, roasted malt, hop, a bit fruity, very light coffee, yeast. Also the palate is well balanced.Nearly opaque black color with a creamy off-white nitro head. Faintly sweet malt aroma. Slightly bitter roasted malt flavor. Non offensive, but very watery.Light aroma of hops and chocolate. Creamy, with a light body and a bit of bitterness. Flavors of coffee and cocoa dominate. Followed by a hoppy finish. Quite refreshing for a stout.UPDATED: JAN 16, 2003 Weak and kind of smokeyOut of a nitro can this pours a deep black body with a stiff, ice-cream like white head which clings heavily to the glassware.  A slightly creamy aroma of milk with an unsettling note of grains. Has a smooth, thin and creamy texture but also with the character of soda pop.  Surprisingly thin and lacking depth in the flavor.  Really quite weak overall.UPDATED: JAN 17, 2005 Draft can. Cappucino colored head.  Brown body.  Initial sip was medium roast coffee with some earthy/root notes.  Finished with a nice hop flavor but had some flat hop notes that seemed unbalanced.  Upon further drinking became very thin and had a dry, bitter hop flavor, not overly complex as it finishes, though as it warmed, some fruity notes came out.  Still retained a dull mildly mossy hop taste to the end.(Drught) Pours very dark with red hints. Creamy head. Roasted aroma with mostly coffee but also a hint of chocolate and cocoa powder. Coffee, roasted and smokey flavour. Low carbonation. Soft and smooth mouthfeel. Light sour and light dry. Pretty light body.(Canned) Smoooooth...feels almost weightless in the mouth,.although the aftertaste becomes more bitter as time passes, which could put off some people.

Not a very strong aroma but there is coffee in it. Tastes of coffee, feels sweet at first but turns into some bitternees.Deep black with tan head. Mild malt aroma. More bitter and less body than Guinness and Murphy\\'s. I agree that it is clearly third among the 3 major Irish stouts.Draught at the Danish Beerfestival 2003: \\tA very nice stout, a bit like Guinness, but with more hops and less sourness.opaque black with a thick creamy khaki head. well roasted chocolate throughout aroma and flavor. light toffee malt and sweet dirt background. very creamy and medium light body that is slightly less watery than bottled guinness draught. a little more carbonation than guinness as well. very pleasing and slightly more flavor than the some of the main stream dry stoutsDraft @ Delaneys w/ clover shaped into the head, Perfect!  Easy & smooth w/ only mild smoked taste. I cant taste any bitterness or hops, or alcohol either?  Great and goes back easy! Very creamy and, as expected, as thick clinging chucks of lace.  Honestly, I prefer it to Guinness... probably b/c of the thinner palate, it just drinks easier.  Very good, & a classic!Very deep, dark crimson ale with a lovely, creamy, light chocolate head. Fully lasting. Milk chocolate, light coffee, soap and creamy caramel.\\tBitter, dark cholate flavor with a blast of espresso. Hints of molasses and vanilla.\\tMedium-bodied with a creamy mouthfeel and very mild carbonation. Lengthy, burnt, grassy finish.\\tGreat session stout!Better off the tap than in the draught can, but a good buy nonethless.  Malty, roasted flavors are abundant.  Gets better as you go along.On nitro at the maproom.  Pours a dark black with a tall smooth white head.   Nose is muted from the nitro, some chocolate, thats about it.  Creamy smooth with chocolate flavors.  Meh, kill the nitro so I can taste something.Decent stout but will always be in the shadow of Guinness. Pours black with an off-white head. Taste is off roasted malt with coffee and chocolate flavors with light hops. Mouthfeel is a little disappointing in that it is a bit watery. Still, a pretty good stout that you should give a try.I liked this one a lot because of its simple stout taste. Nothing too fancy, but it had a nice rich head of foam and a full body.UPDATED: OCT 10, 2009 Tasty...coffeeish and slightly bitter as you would expect from they style.  Little difference between the caned versions of this, Murphys, and Guinness.Nitro can - pours a black with a tan head.  Aroma of malt with a nice coffee taste - a nice creamy brew that tops off a corned beef and cabbage dinner for St Pattys day (a couple days early)Widget can. Head is initially small, creamy, off-white, full lasting. Body is black (but not opaque). Aroma is moderately malty (roasted grain, mild coffee, dark bread, dark chocolate), with a light note of smoke. Flavor is lightly sweet, lightly bitter. Finish is moderately bitter. Light body, creamy texture, soft carbonation, moderately astringent. Nice aroma, but not much flavor, and the mouthfeel is lousy (extremely thin and quite astringent).Roasty aroma.  Black in color.  Smooth and chocolatey taste, heavier than a Guiness.  Overly watery but better than a Guiness...a strange aftertaste (bologna?).The appearance is black with a tan head.  Aroma is a little smokey.  This stuff is very good and it almost the same beer as Guinness.UPDATED: DEC 12, 2009 (bk-can rd-txt, 4 pack)\\tblack, rich, flavorful, malty, slight bitterness/astringency up front.More desertlike than Guinness, being more drinkable and creamier than the G side.  Goes great with animal crackers!!an ok stout, coffe is dominant in aroma, taste has also coffee and mocha with a sweet note, a decent brew but nothing I can drink on regular basisFrom tap at Simone, Helsinki. Roasted, low bitterness. A bit watery maybe and quite easy. What Id want to do is a head to head with Guinness, Murphys and this, because now this seems much lighter.One spin of the death wheel and I was the  recipient of this unpleasnt brew.  But I did rip the top off the can and found that the ping pong ball inside was much more enjoyable than the beer. Yuck!UPDATED: MAY 16, 2006 Draft.  Milk and malt aromas dominate this dry stout.  Texture is creamy and smooth, with hints of coffee and chocolate.  Malts are the main player, though, down to the smooth finish.  A soft and smooth stout.  Dry, as advertised, but without much to differentiate it from other dry stouts.(canned version)\\tBlack with an almost perfect head, which is smooth. Aroma of jar, smoked rubber and licorice. Fresh mouth feel, quite light palate feel but still pleasant. Clear flavor of licorice with some smokiness. Notes of pepper in the flavor too with a dry finish.Nitro Can.  Had this in Cork in 98 and havent had the G since.  Not as heavy and a lot fresher tasting.  Nice and chocolatey, good level of bitterness.  Slightly sweet.  Awesome head and mouthfeel.  Great Stout in a can!Black, wonderful tan head that lasts and a smooth flavor.  More coffee than chocolate, this is great!Can. Black colour with a creamy tan head. Light aroma of coffee. Roasted flavour with coffee and a moderate bitterness. Quite thin.On tap:  I thought i had asked for a Beamish stout? Well i could of sworn i was given a glass of Guinness, but turns out the place only had the G word in bottles.  Dark opaque black and faded white head.Creamy and slightly sweet with a roasted malt. Would drink again and i plan on buying some if i find it in a can or bottle.Weak aroma, decent color, nice lasting head. Weak watery taste. Coffee notes in after taste. Nothing special, wouldnt buy again.Pours out a chocolaty brown with a very fine-bubbled head and lots of fine, descending bubbles like Guinness - clearly the result of nitrogen tapping. An extra half point for that. Smoky, chocolaty aroma has nutty and molasses hints. Flavor is mainly of unsweet chocolate with a molasses undertone and hints of smoke and nuts. Velvety smooth texture has a good tingle to it.UPDATED: SEP 7, 2007 Almost black color. Light brown creamy head. Aroma is slighlty weak, hoppy with roasted coffe and chocolate tones. Flavor is moderately hoppy with licorice and roasty notes, ending in a full smooth moderately bitter finish. Light bodied.Pours near opaque with a big creamy head.  Aroma is of roasted barley.  Taste is also of roasted malts.  A good dry stout, much better than Guinness anyway and usually cheaper.Not bad of a stout.  Its not a smooth as Guinness Draught, though.  I had this once over at the Yard House.Black body with a light tan head.  Roasted malt aroma.  Creamy mouth feel with a bitter roasty taste.  A lot like Guiness but cheaper.  Meh.Draught at Flying Saucer Draught Emporium. Unfortunately, I didnt have my notepad with me so Im having to rate this from memory.  Overall, it wasnt bad, but there are other stouts Id rather have.I always kind of liked Beamish. A change up from Guinness. A slight peppery flavor. Serving: CanNitro at Henry St. Ale House.  Nice cascading pour, but basically flavorless save for some dry earthy notes at the very end.  Ordered this purely for new rating purposes.  Bland and boring.  Not even a good substitute for Guinness.  May have been \"over-nitroed\" by the tap engine if thats possible.Nitro can.  Black in color, smooth creamy white head.  Old, musty flavor, like wet cardboard.  Slightly bitter.  Creamy mouthfeel.  Very smooth, dry finish.  Guinness clone.UPDATED: JUN 30, 2008 Can. Almost black, with a dense tan head. Mild roasted aroma. Lightly sweet, roasted flavor with some coffee, toffee and cocoa notes. Thin body. I was disappointed over this one, have had it on tap earlier and remember it better than my rating suggests. Re-rating coming up sometime. (060201)A very good stout Creamy head, very chocolaty with a finish that was all roasted caramel.  I didn\\'t like it as much as Guinness.  Definitely worth a try though.Black with a grand widget head and lacing, cocoa and coffee aroma with a faint metallic note. Smooth and creamy with a chocolatey flavor and good bitterness. To me very similar to Guinness version but I need to try them side by side.Nitro can.  Poured rich and foamy - dark brown with garnet highlights and a (can you guess it?) thick creamy tan head.  What\\'s up with those nitro cans anyway - the heads seem a little scary to me actually.  Aroma is dark, toasty malts, spent coffee grounds and milk.  Flavor is pretty nice, sweet blackened malts, espresso and cream with a nice bitter character.  Body is thick but flat and lifeless - those nitro cans really seem to suck the life out of a brew (can you tell that I\\'m not a fan of them???)  Not bad, but I\\'d love to try it on draught rather than with this poor imitation widget.Nitro can. Pours almost a chocolate milk color but turns to black with a thick off-white head. Very creamy, with flavors of coffee and bittersweet chocolate. Slight bitterness, but not strong.Pours a nice thick dark brown with a perfect amount of froathy tan head.  Roasted malt aroma, but nothing too complex about it.  Flavor is nice and creamy smooth roasted slightly sweet malts.  Slight dry finish.  Overall, I found this beer very enjoyable, almost like a desert.Nitro-can (4,2% ABV). Impressive light chocolate head... looks like whipped cream. Near black colored with a red glow. Roasted dry malts, coffee-beans and notes of tar in the aroma. Dry taste. A bit salty, with black chocolate, tar again, and dark dry malts. Supersmooth mouthfeel. Long roasty finish. A really nice macro-stout.UPDATED: APR 20, 2008 Canned 50cl. My version was at 4.3 ABV. It pours a black beer with a lasting brownish head. It doesnt have a lot of aromas. Some licorice and buttery elements in the taste. Very smooth, hints of smoke. Lots of tar, rather  pronounced bitterness. Its a lot less sweet than Guinness or Murphys. A highly drinkable stout with a dry finish with notes of seaweed. Best served at a very cool temperature. Second sampling: A very smooth stout, nice smokiness with a huge amount of lemon in the finish.Draught. Black, pale nitro cream head. Nose is little rye bread and dried fruits, mild burned edge. Similar flavor, a tad more roasted maltiness and hops, but still very subtle. Almost medium bodied, boring silky mouthfeel. Just a another nitro stout.Pours very cloudy, but with an enticing black color, and thick nitrogeous head. The head lasts from pour to finish. Good roasted malt aftertaste with a hint of chocolate and espresso. Not as good as other stouts I\\'ve had but still nothing to turn away.NIce stout.  It was on sale, so made it a very nice stout.  I have to admit, I had it in England before, on tap.  And, enjoyed it much more than in the can.  Head lasts a long time, not as long as Guiness.  Coffee tastes.  As expected, little carbonation.  Overall, I would drink it again.  But, there are better Stouts out there.14.9oz can poured the classic nitro infused bubbling cascade and firm half inch creamy tan head with dark dark amber body. Nice looking brew but not really opaque enough for the style. The aroma is sweet caramel, molasses and brown sugar mixing with mild notes of burnt and chocolate malts. It is pretty mild overall. The taste has the typical smooth nitro mouth feel. I get tasty notes of mild chocolate, dark roasted malts, some burnt malts and an under current of molasses sweetness. It becomes a bit astringent into the finish with mild notes of coffee and burnt malts.4 tinnys of beamish and a plate of chips{fries}  with red curry sause. My mouth waters for those olden glory days, spent about 8 days in cork ireland. all I had was the ticket to england, my only plan was to travel, get lousy jobs and drink beer. the best 9 months of my life. Cource that was a WHILE back.  Better,than guinness, heartier than murphys, beamish is amasing. Just been to a friends house,  a friend who secured a keg for a party, and invited my to a pre party taste. Pours the clasic nytro imbeded white, rises to a perfect jet black with just a hint of ruby in the light. Head is just the slightest tint of brown off white. very nice laceings.  Aroma is nutty, cream, and roasted. Palat is thin,  and watery on the tongue, full and heavy in the throat. taste is at firts very robust roasted barley, folowed by a dance of nutty malt and chocolate, a lovley bash of sweet malt and enough hops just to slightly balance the sweetness. Undernotes are of coffie, burnt molasas, cream,  mixed nuts, fig, plumb and ripe peach. Aftertaste is very smokey, with returs of coffie and chocolate, and a simple little hello from the 50/50 floral/bitter hops in the very finish. Overall, some might say that the flavours are a little muted, and that may be true, but look deeper, theres a pot o gold in dere.  Also once had the bottled un-nytro orignal beamish, it was a long time ago, I remember it being the same flavours as the tap but amplified, but as I say, it;s been a while, and I dont think the bottled stout is still avalible. CheersTap. Very creamy, coffeeish, and chocolaty mouthfeel. Very bitter aftertaste, but inspite of that a good stout.Good stout. Tastes like one would imagine guinness extra stout would taste on tap or in pint cans. Less full-bodied than guinness and more of a roasted aftertaste. All in all a good beer. Great head and an attractive pour. Needs to be served a little colder than guinness though.Pint can.  Pours a dark reddish brown with one finger grayish tan head and drippy lacing.  Nose is roasted malt with mild chocolate and coffee.  Taste is Roasty smoky malt upfront with some bitter coffee grounds in the finish.  Lighter mouth feel than I expected.  Not bad. I prefer Guinness to this though.500ml can with a widget. Black with a white coffee like small persistent head. Nutty aroma. Quite thin and watery body, with a roasty coffeish and creamy flavor. Left me quite dissapointed. Doubt Il be drinking this soon or even again.Draught at a pizza shop in Kiel, Germany.  A perfectly beautiful head, just like a Guinness.    As expected, aroma and flavor of coffee.  Toasted, smokey hints, too.  Bitter aftertaste.  A good, standard stout.not bad of a dry stout. pours black with a cremy head and good lacing. aroma and flavor are light coffee, chocolate, and roasted malt. creamy mouthfeel and you can tell that it is pasteurized. not bad I like this over guiness, but alas it is no longer in america from what I here.Pours from the can a dark black with a very dense 1 inch off white head of cream. When poured it has an awesome cascade of bubbles making it look very swirly. Aroma is a solid roasted malt bitterness with a slightly creaminess to follow.  Flavor is a very smooth roasted malt bitterness, moderate carbonation brings the flavors out very well and allows the beer to end on a light semi-sweet dark fruit note.  Overall this stout has a great body and flavor that really makes it an enjoyable stout.Can from Tesco supermarkets in Dublin, Ireland for 1.85 Euro. Preferred over Guinness!Good stout, probably a bit better than guiness.  Is a bit drier with a more smokey flavor.  The cream and the smoke make a good combo, but overall this isnt an amazing beverage.UPDATED: FEB 22, 2005 Dark cola color the beautiful working widget, seems a little more active than the Guinness one, roasted, roasted malt aroma, you can smell the creaminess, naturally a creamy tongue feel, tastes different then guinness, dry aftertaste. This weekend I going to have someone help me blind test taste Beamish Guinness and Murphys to see if they really are distinguishablePint on tap at Stout NYC. Pours an opaque dark brown color, moderate creamy head. Aroma very faint and malty, taste very subtle with a bit of sweetness and a little dry bitterness. Palate is smooth, more of a watered down taste than other dry stouts. Very enjoyable and very sessionable.Nitro can.  Light coffee aroma.  Opaque black with moderate head.  Light molasses/coffee malt flavor with smoky hops finish.  A light but hoppy stout.Not as good as Guinness (what is?), but a very sastisfying stout.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes this style.This beer offers a metallic malty aroma.  It is black with a thick maple colored head.  This thin sweet beer spreads well throughout the mouth as it distributes a mild taste of chocolate and coffee.I sampled this very dark beer from a widget-enabled can on Saint Patrick\\'s Day... it has a very smooth, chocolatey taste, and I prefer it to Guinness.7 oz draught sample.  Dark brown pour with medium frothy head.  Aroma of coffee, burnt toast and nuts.  Mild coffee taste with a bitter dry finish.  Slightly watery, but not too shabby.Nice layered effect in the glass and black as night. light roasty aroma.  You can tst the dry bitterness, with a faint nutty aftertaste. Good, but not greatThis one was really outstanding, given it came out of a can--best beer Ive had out of a can, incidentally.  Very dry, muted but complex flavour.  No initial bite, but bitter taste develops.  Extremely smooth, creamy.  Im not quite sure where people are getting the \"less bitter than guinness\" because this one, compared to guinness draught, tasted more bitter and considerably smoother.  Of course, their extra stout is more bitter, but thats really not an analog to this beer.This came to me in a regular can, no nitro widget. Pours out a deep black color, with a nice tan head on it. Aromas are of\\tmalted barley, burnt malts, and slight coffee in the background. Significantly more bitter than Guinness, more biting and more\\thoppy as well. It\\'s just a little too bitter for me. Still a good example of Irish stout in my book. Not something I could drink\\teveryday, however.Very light malt nose. Creamy champagne layer on the mahagony dark-red body. Bitter chocolate and espresso taste, clean, goes by fast and is very light.A quintessential dry stout...woody and slightly nutty, roasty, very thin, witha huge nitro head and fake creaminess. I guess I need to be Irish....Draught. It cascades on the pour into black w/ ruby hues and a big, dense khaki head that leaves a lot of lacing. The aroma is fresh and is of cream and malt.  The flavor is also creamy with a kind of sharp wood tone up front that smooths out toward the finish. There are also some flat hops detectable, mostly in the aftertaste.Nitro Can 4 pack. Creamy sweet and easy to drink.  Coffee like but very mild.  Great session stout.this is a good drink, and was great value for money in long sallys in galway, which is a great bar.This reminds me of why I love stouts.  Dark and beautiful in color and taste, and better than Guinness.  I just dont conisder it that dry, I thought it was a little sweet.A great macro stout.  Beautiful black beer with raosted malt aroma.  Creamy, dry and bitter flavor with smooth finish.  It\\'s thinner than a craft stout but otherwise quite well done.Tasted on draught and from the can, but reviewed from draught (Not a fan of widgets). Pours a clear dark cola brown, with a dense head of off-white foam. Very little aroma bar some mocha hints. Burnt wood and roasted grain flavours dominated a very dry and watery thin palate. Minimal sweetness, pasty yeast and roasted barley mid-palate, and followed on to a short bitter roasted swallow. If it wasnt watered down (with thanks to Scottish Courage- Wankers!), it would be quite a good Dry Stout.Blah. Typical nitro. Aroma was roasted malt and a hint of coffee. Pour was beautiful as expected. Deep dark brown with a huge 3 finger tan head. Love the look of these beers. Taste was not as good. Thin and watery with just an aftertaste of roasted malt bitterness and a hint of butter and vanilla. Typical of the style.First Rating 12/22/00 A good stout, in my top 25 overall. Better draught than can, but is rich and smooth with a great coffee/chocolate nose.\\tRe-Rate 09/29/02 Pours that pitch-black color that I love, the head is creamy, long lasting and tonnes of lace. Nose is malt, lightly roasted grains, also a tad coffeeish. Front is malt, the top light, the finish is dry, nicely hopped and a decent drinking beer. Ranks #734 on my current 1000 beer master list.Terrific Stout.\\tLove the head.\\tVery drinkable.draught. Super dark red, appears black in most lighting. Theres a fine rolling cascade which leaves a very even and dense tan head. Theres some mild roastiness, cream, and faint sourness in the nose. This is a little light in the mouth for a stout. Theres a bit of smoky coffee grounds and malty sweetness in there. Very drinkable, but doesnt really make any unique impressions.From a can, beer pours (in Hoegaarden glass) a near-solid black, light can penetrate showing a dark brown-red color when held up to light with 3/8 inch to 1/8 inch solid, off-white creamy head.  Aroma is of a faint straw/grass with malt, molasses.  Flavor is of malt with a mild coffee-bitter finish.  Consistency is very thin - like water.  Very nice.  Good beer.  Sampled at 72 degrees Fahrenheit.A very smooth and tasty stout but a tad under guinessHow I ever overlooked this beer is a mystery to me! Poured black with a perfect creamy head, nutty aroma with a cream-chocolate taste and nice long finish, its a shame its so hard to find on tap in Ireland (well in Dublin) and I will be having this againA typical nitro dry stout in the mold of Murphys and Guinness. Always interesting to watch it pour and its solid black with a puffy head. The aroma is faint coffee and roasted malt. The flavor is bitter with some hints of chocolate but dominated by coffee. The palate is thin. Overall decent for the styleDark, smooth and creamy. With roasted malts and strong coffee flavour. Similar to Guinness but not as good.Nearly black, with a thick nitro induced head. Very little aroma, just a hint of roasted barley. Very slight roast and some bitterness. Not much flavor. Drinkable, I guess.Like Murphys, a good Irish stout for quaffing. Typical creamy coffee chocolate notes, great mouthfeel, and thirst-quenching drinkability.Seems to have fairly rich taste, not quite as much coffee flavors as Guinness.Awesome stout.Sometimes it tastes better than a Guinness.Get on draft if you can.Very difficult to get in Holland, but it is my favorite Stout!! The creamy head and the well aftertaste is great!creamy thick head, beautiful black body, but taste of ashtray filled with coffie poured with water, the overal impession that I drink fluid ham,maybe I just dont like stouts.a little less body and less malty but more hops than GuinnessVery similar to Guinness.  At times, it tastes better, at times not.  Id say that get this on tap is the only way to go.  Can also be used in car bombs when Guinness is not available.Sampled from the Draught Can.  Pretty good, I liked it.  I was looking for Guinness so I could make a Black & Tan and didnt see it so I tried this (of course sampled it on its own first).  Black colored, nice thick head and pretty good flavor as well.  Coffee and roasted malt flavor, nice balance and very smooth.  I was surprised how smooth this was for a stout.  Had a little bit of a thin mouthfeel but nothing major.UPDATED: SEP 13, 2006 Not as good as Guinness but better than murphys.  I like stouts the best, and no one seems to be doing better than G at the moment.  OK...Bells Kalamazoo is boss!UPDATED: JUN 4, 2003 This brew poured a small head of fine and medium sized light brown bubbles. Its body is an opaque black brown color. It has mild dark malty aroma. The typical stout flavors of coffee and java are there with an initially very smooth taste rising to a mild aftertaste but no strong bits. It leaves an excellent creamy lacing on the side of the glass. I enjoyed this beer as it went down very smoothly although it does lack the strength of some stouts.Dark muddy brown with a creamy beige widget head. Aroma of caramel, chocolate, soap and European hops. Distinct dry flavor with a dark-roasted, smoky quality and pleasing hop bitterness. Foam and water mouthfeel. I\\'d like to try this one under better conditions (say from a cask) but the widget can is very widely distributed and therefore fair game.Very good looking beer; dark body with small bubbled head.  Feel nice on the tounge going down, but has a nutty-bitter aftertaste that I dont personally care for.The aroma was of cardboard!  The appearance was a dark black with a thick white head.  The flavor again was of cardboard!.  The beer was thick and creamy.  Overall I was not at all impressed with this one, just to darn much cardboard.On tap in Cork, Ireland. Pours a typical nitro dry stout: cool cascading, settles into a deep ruby body with a creamy nitro cap. Crazy lacing from the nitro. Aroma of roasted malt, milk chocolate, coffee grinds, a bit of soy sauce. Taste is a bit watery with roasted malt, semisweet chocolate, coffee. A bit astringent on the finish. Overall light to medium body but too watery for me. But really is not much different from Guinness or Murphys.No longer in stock? I buy it all the time here in Louisiana. Unless this just happened. Aynway, Great brew. Super smooth, better than the Guinness we get. Up there with Murphys. Anyone know if any nitro stouts come in mini kegs?Pours a beautiful almost ebony color with a thick, creamy beige head.  Tastes very malty and almost a bit smoky.  The widget really makes it go down smoothly, and the head is wonderful.  I was surprised at the flavor; it was a lot better than I had expected.Draught at Dublin Airport. Tarry black colour with a beige head; chocolate malt aroma; smooth with a dry malty flavour; gentle bitter finish with milky chocolate and smoke. Very drinkable, not too heavy a pint.Nitro can.  Figured this would be a reasonable brew for St. Pattys day.  Poured reverse-cascading, clear deep mahogany with a thick, creamy beige head.  Nose was of dry, dark, and grainy chocolate and mild coffee... medium roast overall.  Flavor was almost all from dark, roasty malts... dry dark chocolate throughout.. with coffee providing some flavor and bitterness at the edges.  Velvety on the palate and medium-bodied.  Certainly a tasty brew that I will have to revisit.Can - black in color with a slight ruby red tint, huge creamy off-white head, excellent lacing, cascaded much like Guinness does but it didn\\'t last as long, it settled very quickly, roasted dark chocolate nose, very smooth & creamy, very drinkable, slight burnt character in the flavor, hints of chocolate there as well, dry & semi-roasted finish, very nice stoutA Malty Stout...close brother to Guinness.  Not quite as good.  Good stout overallAlot of pubs in London serve this instead of Guinness.  Since Guiness in London is brewed in London, I guess thats really not the end of the world.  Actually once I started drinking local ales and bitters I found this to be kind of a waste of precious pub time.Black colour with a tan head... surprise, surprise. A bit of smoke and nut aroma. It is more approachable for stout neophytes than Guinness, as it is sweeter with more coffee and chocolate notes. Very solid indeed.14.9 oz widget can. On the pour, this looks like a thunderstorm in a glass with millions of tiny bubbles swirling in the glass, like a storm cloud, eventually forming a dense, lasting, half-inch, beige head sitting atop a deep, translucent, garnet-brown body. As picture perfect as the head is, its density creates an olfactory cap on the aroma: faint dark roasted malt and sweet cream are all I get from this one. Light-bodied and thin with a silky mouthfeel and a short, roasted finish, the flavor is of dark roast with a light bitter chocolate, faint coffee and cream and a just a touch of sour tartness at the finish. This is an incredibly sessionable stout and IMO, superior to its Dubliner rival.Bought at the Utah State Store. Pours a pure black body with a thick beige head, really quite a nice pour, it suggests a great beer. The aroma is quite light; caramel malts and some smoke. The taste is quite mild; smoked malts, caramel, light milk chocolate, a very think mouthfeel, and overall a pleasing, but thin beer. I think this beer is much better on tap, Ill re-rate it. Otherwise, a good beer.Good classic Irish Stout.  NIce creaminess and great coloring.  Just a good stout to drink on.(Can).  Mild semi-sweet aroma.  Black body, creamy head.  Similar to Guinness, but with a little more malt character and roastiness.  Mostly bland and too light.Mild roasted malt aroma. Mildly bitter taste with no dominating single flavour. Easy drinking, quite thin feel in the mouthbut still retains enough luxurious, creamy texture. Some dryness on the finish but not too much and it retains its sessionability.Looks a little like cococola, but a nice head. Aroma with coffe and chocolate. Tastes like bitter coffe, but ok for being a dark beer.Im not sure if this was nitro or not--had it on tap--but it sure looked and felt like it. Kind of smoky and a litttle bitter but otherwise just dark water. Everyone thought I was a hardcore beer master for drinking this (do you want a spoon with that?), but theres really not much too it. Guinness holds a slight edge in the watery stout category.Looks like Guiness\\ttaste like Guiness\\tmmmm...Guiness\\t\\tGuiness II, The Black Hole!!!  \\tArrrrrrr.....Beautiful dark body, with a tan creamy head.  Had it out of a can and it was wonderful.  Serve it cold!Seems like a good session beer. An Irish Stout, so dry, but also creamy, mild feel, smooth malts, and little hoppy or floral flavor. Impressive head that says atop the liquid til the end of the glass. Bitterness lingering after you swallow that grows into a mild coffee roast flavor. A great choice in the nitro can, probably better than the big G. Need to try on tap to really compare.I think its better than the New Canadian GUINNESS they are marketing in the states now. Stainless steel no character Guinness is not a good as Original Beamish, wish it was available in bottles. Us old stoutheads remember, Guinness aint what it used to be! Pasteurized so it is safe to drink in Texas.what can i say the gods that make this brew make it with love a rich dark body with a coffee finish  and a silk heavenly head goes great with a cigarPint nitro can. Pours a dark brown w/creamy tan head. I know some dont care for nitro can, but I love the smooth creamy mouthfeel they have.  The nose is of mild smoke with bark and dry leaves. Taste is of smoky peat with roasted malts. This is better than Guinness Draught. Very good. Did I mention the creamy mouthfeel .On Tap at Finnegans Wake, Edinburgh 28/09/2001\\tDark coloured and fruity flavoured stout. Malt finish.A great head when poured with a pretty dark brown to black color.  Looks can be wrong.  I thought the beer was a little on the thin side with very little hops or malt taste.the dryness of the stout is overcome by the choice of hoppsDobozosban jutottam hozz ehhez az r fzethez.Szeretem ezeket a \"stt lelk\" italokat.Igazi stout ez,keser csokis,prklt gabons,kvs ze van.Utze szraz,hosszan tart.Black in colour. Creamy white head. Coffee nose with notes of chocolate. Nice, smooth mouthfeel with roastyness and a quite good bitterness. Pretty longlasting bitterness too. Somewhat watery.UPDATED: MAR 2, 2003 On tap:  Not as dark in the colour as Guiness, but still impressive. Huge chocolate head, that last long. Aroma is a little roasted. Flavour is roasted and a definately more sweet than Guiness and Murphy. Smooth beer with the wellknown bitterness in the end.Nitro draught\\tPicture perfect black body with very dense creamy tan head that paints its way down the glass.\\tSomewhat muted aroma of roasted malt, mocha and toffee.\\tCreamy body, quite full, roasted dryness.\\tNice espreso roasted malt character, some dark chocolate and toffee. Reasonably bitter dry finish.\\tReally solid Irish dry stout, up there with Guinness.UPDATED: JUN 28, 2004 Having had the pleasure of visiting the brewery in Cork, I had the priviledge of tasting Irelands finest stout. Not quite as tart as Guinness in its aftertaste. Mostly smooth and almost sweet. Delicious!Tap at Royal.  Nice cascading dark brown w/ tight creamy tan head.  Cant smell much coming off it, a light acidity/really light roast malt?  Tastes very similar to guinness, with the same light, watery mouthfeel.  Very modest grapey roast malt flavor, no detectable chocolate/coffee.  Sweet, syrupy note to flavor.  Badly lacking, but if you think guinness is good, you will like it.  Awesome head retention though - Ive never had head remeaining after all the beer was gone before!A good stout indeed. Perhaps it is a Guinness clone but it still stands on its own two feet. It is smooth, creamy, and of course tasting of coffee and malt and chocolate. You know those stouts... I like this one, but would probably ordinarily choose Guinness over it. This is somehow a tad thinner.Can. Pours pitch black with a nice thick, creamy head. A hint of bittersweet chocolate and coffee. Roasted malt flavors too. A bit sweeter than other Irish stouts. Very drinkable. The four can offering is perfect for an evening.I think this one is the best out of Guinness and Murphys, really dark, with a creamy head, and very smooth.very similar to Guiness, but maybe a little lighter.  I also thought that it was slightly sweeter and had more of a nuttier finish.  still, a very strong stoutAnother beer I had in Dublin.  A good stout with a roast and coffee nose.  A malt flavor with a decent hops bitter finish. In Dublin Guiness kind of takes the limelight away from all the other beers though.Great looking beer from out of the can.  Dark, chocolate head and Dark Chocolate flavors, but it tasted like dark chocolate mixed with water with no carbonation.  Maybe I just got a bad can, but it was almost like it was flat.  Just tasted like water and chocolate.Nitro pour at the Renn Fest.  Nice stout cascade with a tan head.  Smooth taste with some roast, chocolate, nuttiness.  Nice beer for a hot summer day, like today.Sampled from can. Pours blackened-ruby with a cascading, creamy tan head that left sheets of lacing in its wake. Aroma is toasted malt and coffee. Flavor is balanced with earthy, spicy hops and roasted malts. Medium-bodied at best because of the nitros effects. An all-right dry stout.poured a garnet like dark brown, very smooth and creamy, slight coffeee flavor and bitter finish. somewhat similar to guiness out of the nitro can.From the pub can. This is another silky smooth irish stout that pours pitch black with a nice smooth white head. Very light on the palate with a very creamy texture bringing on a roasty coffee taste. A bit of sourness in the finish with just a smooth bitterness to round it out.On nitro at Murphys Pub in Champaign. Black pour with a transparent ruby red edge, white nitro head.  Aroma was simple, roasty and slightly grainy.  Light bodied, mainly roasty with some bitterness flavor on the end.  Creamy nitro mouthfeel, not really my thing though.  Overall not a bad beer by any means, but not something I will go back to.UPDATED: JUN 1, 2007 Draught.  Nice pitch black color with creamy tan head.  Probably a bit more bitter than Guinness, but tasty in its own right.  I liked it and would have again.Thin bodied and timid in flavor...with slight chocolate/molasses flavor but just too watered down.  Has this been dumbed down for export, too?Pours from the can with the characteristic cascading nitrogen creamy light brown head, but more so than the Murphys that I poured last night.  The beer is a deep brown almost black color.  The aroma is subtle with its notes of chocolate, and sweet grain.  The feel of this is creamy smooth as it hits my tongue, but finishes with a bit of astringency and bitterness.  The taste has notes of chocolate, subtle coffee, which as it warms up begins to become quite a bit more apparent.  Again this is fairly light and could certainly use a bit more roasted malt to pick up the flavor a bit.UPDATED: FEB 14, 2008 After having gotten disillusioned with dry stout in general, as many (esp. from nitro pour/can) are thin, watery, and taste only of burnt toast, I was pleasantly surprised by this, my brothers favourite beer.  From a nitro can, it is almost black with a medium, dense, creamy tan head with creamy lace, a pretty standard appearance for a nitro can beer.  However, the aroma was not that muted, being mild but definite chocolate, coffee, burnt toast, with a hint of cherry - a definite dry stitt aroma but better and more rich and complex than usual.  The taste also was unusually rich and strong, with a defiite chocolate-coffe character with toast, but not at all burnt and quite tasty, with a hint of fruit and with persistent flavour.  It has a nice, light bitterness in the lingering smooth chocolate finish that has hints of coffee.  It is fairly smooth, tasty, and drinkable, and even slightly oily.  Far superior to Guinness Draft, its also far ahead of Murphys.  I just wish I could try it without the nitro.Rather interesting brew from a 16-ounce can. Better than average stout with lots of graininess hops balance. Moderately smooth in a can. I would like to try this on tap.An incredibly smooth and tasty stout.  I actually enjoy this much better than the Guinness widget-can.  A burnt/roasted, sweet taste & aroma with a nice balance of sweetness and dryness.  Expresso-like.  Filling and refreshing.On tap @ D4 in Chicago.  Pours black with a thick tan head.  I thought it was a well done stout.  The aroma is of dark chocolate and coffee.  Nice flavor, although a little thin.  A little bit of bitterness, coffee, and chocolate in the flavor.  It seemed a little smoky as well.This stout has a wide array of flavors that can be tasted as the glass empties. Starts off with coffee and chocolate flavors, and becomes more smokey and bitter as it warms. One of my favorites.  Also, about $15 cheaper per case than guinness (PDC). Could be just a little thicker and less watery.Pour is a jet black with a small tan head.  Aroma is slightly malty but i have to use my imagination to find it.  The first sip you notice how silky and smooth it is. Flavor is coffe and chocolate but very watered down.  Looks good but thats where the good part about this ends.Pours black as coal...Duh? With a nice tan head.Scents of coffee, toffee, roasted malts, chocolate and sugar are predominant.First sip ahd tastes of cocoa and molasses. Slightly watery palate with lingering coffee and toffee.UPDATED: MAR 17, 2009 Can, pours a dark thin black with a fine tan head.  Aroma is sweet and smokey.  Flavor is smooth and smokey.  Kinda thin on the watery side.  Its very good to enjoy slowly.This nitro can pours beautifully, velvety black with a dense tan head.  Aroma is very light, a bit of roastiness in the nose but not much too it.  The flavor is smooth with a touch of espresso to it, but is surprisingly light with a slightly metallic finish.  The body is also light, almost watery.  Its solid, but far from a stellar stout.UPDATED: FEB 13, 2008 Pint Can - Besides Sierra Nevada, this is the best Stout iveever  had.  Miles away from Murphys imo.Draft. It looks and smells like your typical irish nitro-stout. While it\\'s still a mellow tasting stout, it had a bit more of a roasty flavor and a little more sour tang to it than Guniness.Comparable to Guinness in appearance but without the strong aftertaste. One of my favorite stouts. Smooth flavor and a creamy head.The best thing from a can I have ever had.  Great flavor which was completely unexpected.  Much better than guiness from a can. I hope someday I can find this stuff on tap.One of the most beautiful beers.  Pitch black w/ an elegant head that sits about an inch thick on top and never seems to go away.  It was like a fine layer of cream.  Weak but pleasant coffee aroma.  The taste was weakened coffee, the kind grandma used to make (the woman lived through the depression so you can imagine).  A weaker tasting stout w/ a fine clean finish.  Easy on the palate.  A nice stout but it doesnt drink as well as it looks.Beamish is the best of Irelands big three hands down.  This beer pours beatifully out of the can and the cascade seems to last forever.  It has a chocolate, slightly roast coffee aroma and the flavour is sweet and smooth at first with a roasted bitterness in the finish.  If only it were available more widely than Guinness or Murphys.Tap. Excellent creamy head and nice black body. Smells like glass. Fresh flavour, medium palate and short finish. (Some pub in Dublin, 16.03.07)Impressive stout- relatively inexpensive too.  Nice head, and great flavor.With hints of chocolate, a good stout, much heavier than murphys yet surprisingly smooth440ml can, Nitro.  Pours clear, black.  Big lumpy, creamy tan head.  Light quite smokey, sweet chocolaty aroma.  Flavor has a bit of smoke to it.  Sweet malt.  Body is light, watery.Can; in Ireland a few years back, I always preferred this to Guiness.  Classic pour; dark brown with a creamy head.  Love watching a nitro pour.  Aroma of toasted malt, sweet malt, milk/lactic, and cocoa.  A pretty smooth and more complex than expected flavor.  Roasted malt, cocoa, sweet malt, with some toffee and earthy hop notes.  Nice nitro palate. A pretty solid beer.Draught, at 1920, London. Black body with large beige head. Roasted dry aroma, slight ash quality to it. Body was a bit thin though, which without the biggest set of flavours on offer proved a little disappointing.A nice heady brew, very creamy & long lasting head (poured from a cask). Nice lacing. Very malty, some bitterness. In all a fine Stout, I\\'ll have another, please.A stout that isnt heavy, like Guiness, but still has that amazing stout color and texture when poured from the can. Taste is a light roast (compared with other stouts) and seems thinner, but I can deny it goes down quite well. Good for those who find Guinness too demanding.On tap at Napa Valley Grille, Mall of America. Pours a dark brown almost black with a creamy tan head. Decent lacing. Aromas of espresso and dark chocolate. Flavors of roasted malts, espresso, and dark bitter chocolate. Dry and bitter, but better than Guinness.good stout nice and creamy. definately comparable to guinnessThe worlds best stout on draught. It simply cant be beaten. It pours perfectly with its dark color, almost dark purple. Mouthfeel is just soft and pleasant. Taste and aroma of roasted malt. Thick white head. Try it, when you still can!Screw Guinness okay, just screw it.  Cork is were good beer is made. Sometimes its cool to actually have something that was brewed in Ireland rather than Canada by Labatts.  Beamish has more of a complex roasted flavor and a silky almost cocao smoothness that usually is replaced by an off-grain flavor in guinness.  Not to say that I dont like guinness, even though no one in this country knows how to pour a pint of either, it is a classic.  But Beamish is my brand.Black Stout, remembers the guinnes vaguely, but it is less intense, more drinkable...50cl can. Pours black color, creamy beige head. mostly roasted malt aroma. Coffee and roasted malt flavor, quite weak actually. Light, watery feel, enjoyable and drinkable though.16 oz Can.  Floating widget similiar to Guiness for creating extra creamy head.  Pours black with Tan creamy head with only minimal lacing.  Looks like a Guiness (just like photo above).  Little aroma, little taste, just creamy smoothness.  Only wish there were more flavor.Better than Guinness, just. Still too thin and burnt for my taste. Will not buy againLiquid toast. Drink this with a grilled cheese sandwich. Fabulous stout!Pours a near black with some ruby highlights, 1/2 inch creamy off white head sticks around forever and leaves mad lacing. Aroma is of coffee, some cocoa, some chocolate milk. Taste hits first with the roast bitterness, then some dried fruit and some cocoa. Body is medium to thin. Crisp carbonation. Great Irish stout, very sessionable.Poured out from the can under widget nitrogen.  Head lasted the duration, had a little more roast and chocolate than Guinness.  Very dark brown almost black or dark ruby colored.Nitro can.  Poured nicely.  Gave a tan long lasting head with a black body.  Little in the way of aroma.  Had a roasted malty taste with bitter overtones.  Not as creamy as I thought it might be.  Would love to try this classic on tap.Nitro can. Deep brown with a huge, cascading head. Good lacing. Lighter aroma of chocolate and cream (lactose?). Taste seems a little light, too; with chocolate and a bit of coffee and liquorice. Medium-light body. Creamy but thin texture.UPDATED: SEP 2, 2005 this was quite nice, smooth..goood stuff, rivals guinness in the nitro can department..would love to try fresh or on tap. has coffee whiffs in aroma, very pleasing aftertaste and is not watery when considering the nitro can side of things.UPDATED: APR 15, 2006 Canned\\tDark brown, almost black colour. Steady creamy chocolate head. Aroma is roasted malt and coffee, softer than in Guinness. Very smooth taste, dark chocolate, smoked malt, gives mild bitter aftertaste. Junior version of Guinness stout. (7/5/8/5/17 4.2)\\t<Re-rated, draught\\tAlmost opaque black, big creamy expresso head. Flowery, lemony hoppy aroma. Roasted, smooth but a bit watery. Good bitterness in the aftertaste. (7/5/6/3/14 3.5)\\tRe-rated, draught\\t(7/5/6/3/14 3.5)Of course we must consider this as compared to Guinness.  Aroma and flavor are a bit smokier and less blended.  Mouthfeel lighter than might be hoped for, and Ill agree with hopasaurus rex that the finish is wanting.  Overall, its tasty and does the job well.  A slightly above-average draft dry stout.Pours mahogany/black into an English pint.  Widget definitely did its job - very defined hot chocolate head on top of the coal colored stout. Negligible roasted cocoa aromas.  Creamy upfront with maltiness that leans to cardboard and turns slightly sour and metallic in the finish.Very good stout that I may have rated higher in earlier years when I was more into Stout.  First had this beer when I was in Dublin and later found it to be Samuel Becketts favorite in his lifetime.UPDATED: NOV 3, 2007 Nitro can. A milkshake stout, obviously comparable to Guinness, but I did not taste them side by side. Beamish isnt too heavy, which I like. It seems to have a few more flavor aspects than G. If you dont like G., dont bother with this. If you like G., then you might prefer Beamish.On tap. Good looking black beer with a thick head. Not much aroma and taste of roasted malt with a bitter finsh.Nitro can - pours a blackcolor  with a small tan head, Litte to no carbonation,Flavor is a very smooth roasted malt bitterness,almost perfect to be honest. Flavors of malts and just a hint of a hop. Great beer.Mild dark roast malt aroma.Dry mild coffee flavor with fine carbonation.Dry slight hoppy coffee finish.Black colour. Compact whiteish head. Malty aroma with hints of biterness. The foam is quit bitter, but the beer got a somewhat balanced taste with a bit on the bitter side. Dry finish.--See notes for Guinness--  Seriously though, I think it really comes down to brand loyalty/availability here (much like with Murphys too).  A fine beer but way too mainstream.  Good but could have so much more character.  Feels nice in th mouth.Nitro can: light fruity and nutty aroma, a hint of coffee; subdued, malty and roasty flavor, notes of smoke and metal, a tad dry in the finish; great creaminess but lacking in bodyUPDATED: JUL 16, 2006 Fluffy pillowy head that settles down but lasts the whole time, there was very little lacing. The initial flavour was bitter and dry with a slightly watery texture. Nice stout slightly thick.Can w/ Widget  Pours Black with a milky white creamy head like a nitrous beer should.  Aromas are roasted nuts and bittersweet chocloate.\\tFlavors are very \"burnt\" and almost ashtray like.  Feel is very thin and the general taste is certainly not complex.  A dry bitter trailer. I like stouts, but not these \"dry\" ones so much.Ehh, not bad but I prefer Murphys Irish Stout. Not too bad if you like cream.I for one enjoyed Beamis Irish stout. Nice pour, excellent aroma and black as the night sky. Lets not forget the taste, very crispy full bodied palate pleasure. Bought in a four pack at Wilco. The most lavish distributor near my house. Next to the six pack store on the Boulevard. Awesome!pretty smokey. wish it was a little fruitier16 oz widget can for $1.99. Surprised I never tasted this before, always see it on the shelf.  Big beautiful rolling pour, what a show. Choco aroma. Toasty chocolate hints on the taste buds. Very flat. Not too bitter. Lacking personality but has more than most flat beers. A little roasty. Perhaps just a little better than the typical widget can nitro beer. Not too much of a bitter finish, thankfully.  I found out the way to drink these widget beers is to gulp it immediately after pouring when really cold, otherwise it turns into a watery drudge in the glass if you let it sit.Not a bad stout, but not on the same level as Guinness. Beamish is also a tad too thin for my taste, yet what it delivers isnt too bad. Nice, mild coffee/choc taste and a clean finish.Canned with the widget. These canned beers from the British Isles always give such a smooth creamy head.  This one is no exception.  The flavor is quite mild though, almost too smooth. Slight malty aftertaste, but not much at all.pretty much the same as Guinness Draught. a bit more fruity though and slightly lighter in colour. more pleasant roasted flavours. i had it out of a can. i would rate it slightly higher than Guinness Draught.440ml can from Country Club Liquors. Typical colors for a nitro pour stout. Cocoa brown haze slowly rising from the bottom to the top turning into a very thick, very long lasting and heavily lacing beige head. Nose is light chocolate and coffee notes. Flavor is light chcolate and slight caramel mixed with some yeastiness. Body kind of watery but what do you expect from 4.1%. I may have never rated this but I saw the post about it being cut to promote Murphys sales. GFlad I saw some cans and tried it. I will have to buy out the rest. Great session brew! Too bad it will be gone.[draught] I feel a bit inadequate at rating stouts, because I can\\'t decide if I really \"like\" these beers or not... \\tAnyway, I liked my Beamish. It was not as black as I expected, with a creamy and solid-looking head. Toffee-like and roasty aroma: I would have expected some traces of chocolate, but didn\\'t find it, which was a bit disappointing. Bitter, smooth, smokey taste, with a dry aftertaste.dark, very smooth but suprisingly light.  I thought it could of had a little more flavor.A fine stout.A very light stout in terms of overall flavors. Creamy palate, but seems a bit watery. Some hop and malt notes, but for a mainstream Irish Dry Stout, I prefer Murphys.(Apr 13, 2005) Can. Dark red-brown color. Clean chocolate with some caramel. Soft, creamy mouthfeel that finishes dry roasted with a note of chocolate and just barey noticable roasted sourness.UPDATED: MAY 26, 2005 This is very similar to Guiness and Murphys though it might be a bit more along the lines of a peppery coffee roast than the other two.  The hops are very mild.  Theres no carbonation and the thin mouthfeel is balanced by the creamy head.A dark/black beer with a fine very long lasting head. Not much aroma but hints of smoked malt. The flavor though is fantastic, it is smooth with notes of smoke, chocolate and tar - a fantastic stout taste. This is one of my favorite stouts.I have had this on tap numerous times and my second farvorite dry stout next to Murphys. Page 44 of MJs GBG and only 477 Classic Brews to go.beautul color and aroma. Light and smooth with a hint of smoked roasted peanuts. Mellow and rewarding as you continue the pint. My least favorite between Guinness, Murphys and Beamish stout, but still very satisfying.I cant believe this rates so highly. There are many better stouts out there. Milky/creamy lactic taste.Beamish surpasses its more famous and overrated counterpart (Guinness) in almost every way. It is perhaps a tad bit thinner, but the richer flavor with chocolate/coffee tones definitely make up for that. Had to lower the rating after having a much better brewpub brewed dry stout.Almost industinguishable from draft Guinness as far as I can tell. Maybe very slightly smoother, with a smidgen less bite at the end. Served too cold (presumably so that it can be served quickly without waiting for the settle)to get much of a handle on any nuances of aroma or taste. OK but nothing to get too excited about. Draft, Pride of Cherbourg Ferry, December 2003.Looks good, tastes completely innocuous. A bit light on flavor but so unofensive and terribly drinkable. Much like the other nitrogen widget beers but noticeably less sour. Perfectly fine beer.Thinner, weaker, sweet tasting stout.  Carmel hints and very averate aroma.Oh so very thick.  When I first poured it out of a draught can I thought it was a milkshake.Havent seen this in England for some years so I was very surprised to see it in a widget can in a beer supermarket in Birmingham, From the wordibg on the can it was exported to the States the re exported to the U.K.Pours as you would expect from a widget can-like exploding mud.When it settled down it became reasonably pleasant to look at.Taste was dry  but a little thin. Now i can see why i never tried it when it was easily available.Nitro can pours brown black with an off white creamy head.  The aroma is roasted malt and chocolate.  The flavor is roasted, chocolate, woody, and overall dry.  The palate is creamy.  Overall, this one is OK and I like better than Guinness.Draft. Pours deep, murky brown with an insanely creamy tan head.Aroma of chocolate, malts, yeast, and hints of spice. Medium body for a stout, incredibly smooth finish. Good dry stout.Can, 0.5 l. A very delicate aroma. A tasteful stout. I like the flavour and the finish.Draught. Pours black with creamy white head. Smooth aroma of roasted malt and chocolate. Roasted malt and chocolate flavour. Smooth light bitter finish. This is great on draught.Looks nice enough, even poured out of a widget can (never tried it before so it was fun) but still not particularly exciting.\\t\\tThe coffee flavous of these stouts just don\\'t agree with me. Granted, I try to be fair, it\\'s not a bad beer really.\\t\\tThis one\\'s more bitter than a Guinness, otherwise there\\'s not much in between, except that this one\\'s more full bodied. I might re-rate this, not bad, quite interesting but nut really hitting the spot this time around.Draught @ lbaren, Copenhagen. Dark brown color with a large creamy excellent lacing fully lasting light brown head. Aroma is moderate malty and some smoke, notes off coffee / chocolate !! Flavor is moderate sweet with a average duration. Body is light to medium !! texture is oily. It was a bit disappointing.This is one of my favorite Irish stouts.  It is much better in Ireland though.From tap. Another very good Irish stout. Will never replace Guinness or Smithwick\\'s for me but was a welcome change of pace during my pub-crawl across Ireland.Damn close to a Guinness.  The only difference that I notice is that Beamish is a little more bitter.  Great stuff, though.  Drink up!This is pretty much a carbon copy of the canned Guinness, so it has all the same strenghts and weaknesses. I would always choose a draught over a can but this is great for home use. That widget definitely has a Pavlovian effect on me. I salivate now whenever I hear it. If Budweiser ever figures that out I am in trouble.UPDATED: JAN 26, 2005 re-rate coming soon.A good stout. Creamier than a Guinness and doesnt have the strong coffee flavor. A nice stout in its own right though.I find very little separates the likes of Beamish and Murphys from Guinness and will drink all 3 interchangeably. Served from the nitro-taps the looks are outstanding. Easy drinking on the palate with a roasted maybe even smoke flavor with slight nutty and chocolaty tones in the finish. Not over-dominanant and pretty easy drinking. I could easily spend a night with this one.UPDATED: FEB 5, 2003 taste consists of thin soapy chocolatey malt body followed by vegemite on burnt toast. slightly sour, like guinness, which i dont mind in a lambic but prefer to do without in a stout. but at least it\\'s not sweet.Pours black as night with a nice tan head.  Aroma is roasted malt with a hint of coffee.\\tMouth feel is thin for a stout, but lively with carbonation.  Flavor is mostly roasted malt, but has a nice hop bitterness as well.  Finish is pretty smooth.  All in all a good stout.  Drinking it in Ireland made it all the more enjoyable.Can. Very dark brown with a medium creamy head. Looks nice. It begins with a soft coffee aroma, which later gets better with notes of roasted malt, chocolate and some smokiness. Flavor is roasty, of malt and coffee, medium bitterness and a bit sour. Light body, milk-like thin texture. Not a big fan of nitro stouts, I prefer thicker and stronger ones.UPDATED: APR 15, 2003 I\\'ve decided that these nitro stouts are not worth a comment. We all know what they are.UPDATED: FEB 18, 2005 On tap at Firewaters. Dark brown in color with a wisp of a head. Not too much of one. Seemed watered down.  Aroma of malt but very subtle malt aroma. As is warmed up much more roasty. Served cold, too cold for me. Ok.UPDATED: MAY 29, 2009 2009-05-20.Ruby tinged black body with a big creamy tan head and lace. Flavour is sweet dark malt, pleasant moderate roast, bitter chocolate undertones. (6+) Aroma is quite muted, light roast and ephemeral chocolate/coffee touches if you look hard for them. Smooth average to thin bodied palate feels a tad light for the beer. Bit more bland but slightly more drinkable than Guinness.  6+/5/6/3/13 - 3.3On tap at Bru Bar, Cork\\tNovember 2004. Can. Cascade widget pour yields a ruby tinged black body with a large creamy beige head. Aroma is mildly roasty with some tiny underlying hints of licorice like notes. Body is very smooth and creamy but a tad thin for a stout, tries to compensate with the nitro widget with some success. Flavour has an underlying sweetness with a mild dry bitterness, particularly in the finish. Mild roast throughout. Muted and restrained, bit watery at times.  6/4/5/3/12 - 3.0UPDATED: NOV 14, 2007 On tap.  I didnt really smell much of anything.  First of all this is better than a Guinness, it lacks the annoying sour after-bite.  The flavor of Beamish is a bit more roasty and I even sense some molasses notes.  Appearance is almost identical to Guinness.A damn good stout. I liked this even better than Guinness.  A touch richer and had a great chocolate flavor.A Guinness clone indeed. Very, very close to the original Irish stout in color, head, mouthfeel and aroma. Flavor is also similar, tasting of roasted coffee, malt and chocolate with a faint woodsy taste. Seems like a 90% Guinness solution with a bit of watery coffee added. Good, nonetheless. A very GOOD copy of Guinness Draught.Dark red color, big creamy tan nitro head.  Burnt wood, little roast and a familiar sweet caramel note in the nose.  Body is caramelly sweet with a touch of piney hops.  Finishes thin and lightly roasty.  The widget doesnt do this beer any justice, a bit disgustingly sweet for me.Very black. I couldnt tell in the pub whether it is opaque. Small head. Sharp bitterness up front, then a smooth finish. Nice average dry stout.I had the can draught flow version.  Not bad..pretty good I guess.  I had the luxury of having it beside a Guinness.  No comparison.  Guinness is the finest.  Still, if I couldnt find Guinness, this would be a nice alternative.when i poured this and smelled it i thought it was going to be awesome, but then i tasted it and it was the same watery disappointment that is guinessHad in a 16 oz nitro-can. Poured to a brilliant black color with thick creamy tan head that lingered to mid glass but left little lacing. Nose was very muted, though I did catch a hint of chocolatey coffee. The flavor was much the same as the nose. Mouthfeel was thin and watery, which, unfortunately, carried over to the finish.\\t\\tAt only 4,1% abv, this is just too bland of a beer to look this good off the pour. What a shame.WOOO HOOOO, I love Beamish. God bless the Irish, Beamish and Crawford and the Cork brewing company. Of course now its brewed by Scottish and new castle. Anyway, a dry Irish stout, black in color. I love the head thick thick thick, lasts forever in my glass. Served at 46 degrees. I love the cascade of the head in my glass and watch it like a waterfall to the bottom of my glass. No carbonation, smooth like an espresso and carmel. I have a new favorite!Thin stout flavor, roasted malt flavor that is a little more robust than regular Guiness, a decent example of an Irish Dry Stout.Fairly predictable, mass produced stout. Nice head, looks great but lacks body. Flavour is quite insubstantial. Watery finish.a wonderful irish beer, not a fan of stouts because they have a very rough aftertaste but this is a pretty damn good one. not on the level of guinness extra stout but still a very good drinkable beerAs canned Irish dry stouts go, this is a very good beer.  The Flavor is smoother then Guinness and more robust then Murphys.  The last suprise it held was its rich chocolate flavor.Aroma of roasted malt.  Solid black color with a long lasting tan head.  Flavor is primarily bitter roasted malt with a bit of sweetness.  Long dry finish ends with a coffee note.  Expected a less thin body.coffee and chocolate aromas. black color with a dense creamy head. dry creamy roast malt chocolate covered coffee bean flavors. lingering roast malt bitterness for the finish. a typical dry stout but I prefer a carbonated stout over a nitrogenated stout. I think the nitrogen creamyness hides too much flavor from the beer.espresso and chocolate with light floral hop aromas.\\tblack with small coffee coloured nitro head.\\tbitter dark chocolate and raw sugar flavours.\\tthin/medium palate with heavy bitterness.\\toverall, it\\'s a bit too unbalanced towards burnt malt/dark chocolate bitterness.Boring, thin, below average overall.  Needs more going on, not enough flavor or presence to find much specific fault.  Amazingly thin for such a dark beer, even the N02 carb was off.Very similar to Guinness in every way. Maybe a little less coffee flavor and creaminess, but still tasty.Very opaque stout with a good, thick, creamy head.  Full flavoured with lots of malt, caramel, and a bit of liquorice.  A good, solid stout with a strong, dry bitter finish.Another mediocre stout at the Scranton St. Paddys day parade/  Black color with a creamy head.  Minimal aroma of roasted malts, and a little chocolate.  Taste was the same.  Not a great stout.Strong, dark, roasted coffee and chocolate flavor.  Beautiful creamy tan head.  Goes down very smoothe with a great aftertaste.A taste of ash but not very intensive. A round mellow aroma and a generous head offers a nice relaxing ten minutes in a comfortable chair. No great stout, but OK.on tap. Very dark with a thick tan head from the nitro. Dry coffee and roasted malt scents. Slightly bitter roasted flavor. Nice mouthfeel with a dry aftertaste.Nitro can.  Pours almost a chocolate milk color but turns to black with a thick off-white head.  Very creamy, with flavors of coffee and bittersweet chocolate.  Slight bitterness, but not strong.  Will be sorely missed when my local liquor store runs out.black with a medium sized, light tan, creamy head.  light roasty aroma.  very nice chocolate, roasty, smoked flavor.  light but creamy, milky palate.  i love these nitro cans.14.9oz can, 09/11/07 on the bottom of the can, assuming this is the best by date.  Black with ruby highlights and a beautiful cascading 1.5 finger creamy light beige head that lasts until the end.  Soft aroma of milk chocolate, roasted malts, light grain, and thats about all I can get.  Flavor is roasted malt and grain up front, light unsweetened cocoa and a semidry finish.  Minimal carbonation with a thin body.This is probably the best tasting beer in the world. My favouriteT Dark, almost black color with creamy tastefull and delicate head. There is a touch between chocolate, nuts and coffe in this beer. Serve this beer extra cold, then its unbeatable :) :)From a can with a widget, this poured a very dark brown with a tan hand and lots of bubbles below it.  Nose of roasted malts with chocolate and a hint of coffee. Very smooth mouthfeel. Flavor is mild and lightly bitter. A very drinkable dry irish stout and similar to Guinness and I actually like it a little better.Pours a dark color black-brown.  The head is is really creamy.  The smell is of roasted malts.  The flavor is alittle bitter and of roasted malts.  This is a fairly good brew. Would recommend.Nicely bitter and suprisingly tasty. Everything is pretty low key but after drinking half a pint you are so going to finnish the whole thing and perhaps get more afterwards. Unlike Guinness this has some definitive roasty coffee notes that I associate with the word stout.Very good stout, good body, color and aroma. Bitterness at an ideal balance.Weak and thin.  Not chewy like a stout should be. Makes my stomach hurt.nitro pour @ the B.O.P.... pours a transparent blackish brown with a creamy nitro head. very mild aromas of wood, cream, roasty malts and coffee. tastes like half a pint of guinness topped off with mineral water.... wood, roast, coffee and lacto sweetness with a lightly bitter finish. thin body and watery texture. il rerate with the can...Is everyone here fucking nuts?!  If you are drinking this from a can, it is neither a great stout or even a decent stout.  The flavor is weak and thin along with the body.  This is completely a cardboard cut out of a good stout.  Sure it looks great but hell does that matter when it tastes like roasted water?  This is not what a stout should taste like.  Even Guinness from a can is terrible.  Aurther Guiness would be rolling in his grave right now if he knew what they were doing to Irish stout by putting a nitrogen widget in them.  Nitrogen=thin, bland beer with beautiful creamy bland head.  Il pass.Big, tan, creamy head over black opaque body. Lots of creamy\\tcarbonation in the body that slowly settles into the head, sharply\\tdividing the beer into black body and tan head. Aroma is relatively\\tfaint, consisting mostly of roasty maltiness and some metal with some\\thints of toffee-like sweetness. Taste is deep, roasty treacle leading\\tinto a sharply dry finish, which is very bitter, with notes of steel.\\tA good stout, if somewhat light and watery. Overall, its perhaps a bit brutal without really offering enough in return for the brutality.\\t\\t(0.5l can in glass.)Appearance: black color. A beautiful head, very consistent, homogeneous, beige color, enough lasting, with an incredible floating-over-liquid and good adherence to glass.\\tAroma: toasty and some wheats smells. Light traditional smells for the style, that is, chocolate, coffee with milk and vanilla. Light metallic aroma. Helped for the widget.\\tFlavour: some disappointment, light toast and wheat presence. Slight and ephemeral figs touch. Final with dryness from hops and toast, as well a metallic and slight mentholated note. Toasty-bread aftertaste.\\tPalate: too light body for the style, watery texture.

Aroam of roast nuts, bitter chcolate and coffee. Taste is coffee/chocolate/nuts. Palate is lite and gets watery.UPDATED: MAY 13, 2003 Nice thick creamy head and pleasent malty aroma.  Taste is as rich as Guiness with the same wonderful burnt coffee flavor, but slighly stronger finish.OK, we all know that nitrod stouts look great.  Beyond that, what do they offer?  Not much in my estimation.  Absolutely NO aroma other than metal on this puppy. Thick creamy head (duh) and a black, opaque body.  Watery up front; nutty in the middle; finishes with a roasted nut flavor and fairly bitter.  Thin and generally bland.  Nothing to write home about and I wont be going out of my way to find this.  I wont even drink it again if it IS in my way.Black, bitter-roasted & smooooth !!UPDATED: JAN 2, 2010 Looked like a stout should look like: rich, black with a creamy white head. Roasted malt aroma. Not as creamy than other dry stouts. The beers main fault is a poor mouthfeel and aftertaste. Cheaper than Guinness and Murphys but unfortunately its easy to see why.Another solid Irish stout - Id say the flavor is somewhere in between a Guinness and a Murphys - the head is not quite as solid as the others (bigger bubbles)UPDATED: JAN 21, 2008 More flavorful than Guinness when served from the tap,  but from the draught can it is hard to tell the difference.\"Widget\" can. Pours wonderfully. Thick, tan head that lasts forever. Aroma of roasted malt. Creamy on the palate, mild flavors of chocolate, malt, and some coffee on the backend. I have not tasted a nitro can stout that I dislike yet.Off the tap at some Irish bar. This had a creamy off-white head. Dark stout body. Roasty aroma of course. Roasty malts with a little bit of bitterness. Tiny coffee flavor. Mostly just dry and creamy. More or less Guinness or on par with it at least.Beer 6 Summer 2006 trip in Europe.  Drank on 6/30/06 on draft at The Highlander in Paris, France.  I had this fine Irish stout while watching Germany defeat Argentina in the 2006 World Cup.  The beer is a typical stout but is quite tasty.I had this beer on tap in Missoula. The malted full body was surprisingly light in weight. I was absolutely hooked by the finishing aroma and the feeling of spice in such a mysterious and unique stout.Even out of the can (with the ball), this poured exquisitely with the a casually developing milky soft head.  There\\'s a slight peat to the aroma.  The beer drinks as smoothly as milk, with a very understated smoky flavor.  I\\'m not a stout fan, but this is a beer full of character.I have been drinking Murphys for 3 years from keg at home but switched to Beamish. It has better head, better color and better flavor. Guiness is good when Im out at pub, but a little to powerful for day to day consumption.On tap. Almost blach with good head. A bit too mild for my taste. But a pretty good mainstream stout.Another low ABV Irish stout, that doesnt really stand out from the others.  Dark with a light tan head, roasty malt flavor, and a lightly bitter finish.  Decent, just not awe inspiring.From a nitro can poured black with a fair amount of thick head.  Nice toasted malty flavor with a quick finish.I guess I just dont like stouts.  It looked excellent, but the taste was just nasty.  I didnt like it at all.On tap. Not as bitter as other Irish stouts but not as much flavor either. Just because its harder to find than Guinness (or even Murphys) doesnt mean its better.Draught (can): Standard black body below a creamy cream colored cream.  Toasted rye aroma with hints of milk chocolate and earth. Dry with a light burnt walnut finish. Nitro makes it seem thin and flat, otherwise a pretty OK brew.Virtually identical to Guiness Stout in appearance and flavor-dark black with lingering foamy head. Smokey malt with coffee notes.Mild bitterness.This beer has a creamy taste from its light-brown head that stays to the last drop. Almost black in color but with thin body.  Suttle flavor of the bitter roasted starbucks coffeeVERY GOOD STOUT, ALOT SMOOTHER THAN GUINESS, AND NOT AS BITTERCan.  Pours a black color that takes some time to settle with a very tight, large brownish head.  Aromas of molasses, roasted and toasted malts, and a hint of chocolate.  Palate is extremely creamy and smooth, almost perfect to be honest.  Flavors of malts and just a hint of a hop.  Great beer.Black, creamy, toasted coffee, fairly smooth but a little watery.  Nice bitter finish.Sampled at the Jacksonville Beer and Food Festival.  Beer pours almost black with an off white head. Malt roast aroma, with al creamy palate. Finish is  bitter.  A nice stout in comparison to the usual.This is the mildest of all the Irish stouts in my opinion. This beer has a good coffee like malt character, and it also has some nice roast bitterness, signature traits in dry or Irish stout. But the flavors of Beamish, especially the roastiness, are tame compared to that of Guinness, and even Murphys. Beamish pours to a deep brown/black color with a creamy white head, and a moderate to soft carbonation. If you have a nitro can, it will cascade down the glass like draught Beamish, the bottled version will produce a tanner, bubbly head. The nose on this beer is malty. Hints of coffee, and slight roasted barley aromas are balanced with some nice hop aromatics. The malt backbone is quite lean, but mild malt flavors of coffee, a touch of chocolate, and roast coat the tongue. This beer finishes with some mild roast up front, then dries to a slight bitter roasty flavor, and some hop bitterness.\\t\\tI like this beer, but I am a stout lover. Beamish is my least favorite of the Irish stouts from Ireland, but I do enjoy it, and buy it a few times a year. This is a great stout to introduce someone into the stout world. The flavors are mild, but they are there, and this is a very good dry stout. This is a very drinkable beer, and I enjoy this one in hot weather, or when I feel like having more than a few. I would match this with shell fish. Oysters and stout are a classic dish. It would also work well with beef or lamb dishes.Can, at home.\\tBlack with a beige head, fully lasting, no lacings. Aroma light to moderate malty (burnt), light hoppy. Flavor light to moderate sweet and bitter, short duration. Light body, watery, flat carbonated.Great pale creamy head.  I am a sucker for the widgeted cans. The flavor is a little more smokey than the Guinness.  A great alternative to the standard.Blac, big creamy beige head. Sweet, coffee-like and malty nose. Full body,  bitter, bit dry, smooth and sweet. Sweet, dry, coffee-like and long finish.Dark coca cola coloured beer with a small creamy head. Roasted coffee aroma. A tiny bit more watery than Guinness and Murphys .Black with creamy head. Week aroma with notes of roasted malt. Sweet flavor with roasted malt, coffee, light chocolate and tar. Ends a bit watery.From the widget can: pours deep cola brown with nice cascading effect leading to about 1 inch of choc. milk colored foam. Mild aroma of chocolate. Its a bit thin, although balanced with mild bitterness and barely a burn, finishing with slight lactic sourness. The flavors are pretty weak for a stout, but maybe this ones just old.Beautiful settling of the head.  Leaves a 1 in thick dense, creamy head of light brown.  A thing of beauty.  Moderate aroma with roasted grains, a bit of cherry, coffee and a hint of steak sauce.  Color is a deep, dark brown.  Flavor is smooth and easy drinking.  More roasted grains, coffee and a touch of licorice.  Little watery for the palate.  Finish is dry and a bit bitter and roasty.  A very good stout that when poured from a draught can is a site to behold.CAN. Body is black with crreamy brown head. I liked this more than Murphys, although I am not a huge fan of stouts in general.Can from Swedish \"Systembolaget\". November 2005.Nice dark color, thick creamy head. Hoppy scent, nice creamy mouth feel. Roasty or burnt flavor.ok, the looks of this beer is wonderful...but the taste of it, OMG!! it is so Yuck!!Best on tap at your local pub (if you can find it). Great look for a stout. Mild aroma, wonderful mouth feel. Creamier than Guiness. Pleasant finish, especially when to warms up a little.14.9 ounce widget can. Pours a coffee-like brown that cascades into a beautiful pitch black color. A finger width frothy tan head appears after the pour that lasted throughout the duration of the beer. The pour reminded me a lot of Guinness. The aroma was very roasty with hints of chocolate and coffee. This was a very smooth and light-bodied beer. Tasted hints of chocolate, coffee, and roasted malts with a nice malt aftertaste. Slight lacing on the side of the glass. I am a huge fan of Guinness and feel that this a a good contender. However, there is something about Guinness that I like a little bit more.Im a guinness draught drinker, But sometimes its nice to have somthing thats a little different, yet not totally straying far from home.\\t\\tThis beer is GREAT! the head is a little less thick then guinness and a little darker as well. \\t\\tPerhaps even a little nicer aftertaste than guinness draught, a tad bit sweeter perhaps?  \\t\\tGuinness Drinkers, this beer is as good, its a photo finish!\\t\\tone thing I did notice,I can drink Guinness after Guinness, 4-5 pints at a sitting and the alcohol does not affect me, 2 pints of Beamish had quite a kick I was not expecting, Nice buzz,very very very nice beer.\\t\\tunfortunatly i have heard rumors or there distributor dropping the brand in the us.  what a shame.2009 Can.  Very similar to Guinness.  Very dark, kind of an ebony almost, with a brownish cream colored head.  Tastes like a sweeter Guinness, which goes with the sweet caramely flavor.  Definitely worth your time.Presentation: It was poured from a 440ml nitro \"widget\" can into a pint glass.\\t\\tAppearance: Its body is black as night and opaque with a typical nitro head on top. The head is a creamy light tan color, very thick and very creamy. It has very good retention and makes cool lacing on the glass as I drink.\\t\\tSmell: The aroma has heavy bready malt character with mild roasted notes and some mild mineral like hops.\\t\\tTaste/Mouth The flavor is bready, creamy and sweet with dark roasted malts up front. This quickly dries out with more roasted coffee like bitterness and hop bitterness taking over. (There is much less nitro taste here than some other nitro stouts I have tried.) The finish is fairly clean with some mineral like hops bitterness quickly fading off the tongue. \\tThe texture is thin yet somehow very smooth and creamy too, with a light to medium body.\\t\\tNotes: Of the big three nitro stouts (Guinness, Murphys and Beamish) Beamish is my favorite.The best of the Irish stouts.  Better than Guinness, but it doesnt get as much play.  Its hard to find, since most pubs will favor guinness over it, but if you can find it, drink the keg dry.Beamish is good, don\\'t get me wrong, but it can\\'t top Guinness.  It\\'s a bit sweeter, but lacks the creamy complexity of Guinness.  It\\'s a damn good stout though.UPDATED: JUL 26, 2007 Got the widget can and I really liked this. Ive been a fan of Guinness for some time, but this had a little more too it, and I would put this ahead of Guinness. Beautiful pour, thick foamy tan head.  Heavy roasted malt aroma.  But where it earns the edge is in the taste.  It doesnt have the tanginess in the aftertaste that I found with Guinness.  Its smooth, chocolatey, and is very drinkable.  Its too bad the comparisons are made in relation to Guinness when they could easily be the other way around.Draught. The aroma is smoky. Black colour, small, creamy light brown head. The flavour is also quite smoky with some malt bitterness. Changed recipe?Nitro-can From 14th street bodega. well it looks like guinness but just not as good, A Clone if you will next time il jus get the real thing .Ehh...Canned. Opaque, red-tinged black. Creamy beige head with decent lacing. Faint milky malt aroma. Some bitterness, burnt nut flavor.Extremely dark-red (opaque) with the cascade-effect running through (up the hill). Massive thick and creamy tanned head. Mild aromas of nuts and alcohol . Taste is very smooth, with hints of molasse, and not bitter like Guinness. Dry finish. Good mouthfeel, but not as thick (and filling) as the above-named brew. I really enjoyed this Irish Stout, but still my favorite stays the St. Ambroise Oatmeal Stout (in the overall stout family).Canned 50cl, straight from Ireland. Pours out  an almost opaque black. Beautiful creamy head that lasts forever. Aroma is... well... it smells like a mens room. Nevertheless the flavor is wonderfully rich, smoke, malty, some coffee beans. Nice lasting bitterness.UPDATED: SEP 2, 2007 Nitro can.  At last I found this beer in Southern California.  To me, this beer beats Guinness in the aftertaste.  The wheat malt added to the mix adds just the right amount of sweetness to the milk chocolate and coffee flavor.  The pour looks just as good or better too, with the downward cascading brown to black pour.  Lasting, creamy head.  Espresso/chocolate aroma.  Hopefully BevMo will continue to carry Beamish.great stout , not so roasted as guiness and very creamy u just want moreI compare all Irish Nitros to Guinness. This one is watery and too sweet. The after taste is not of my preference, almost a chemical feeling. I wouldnt drink this again.Pours black with a fine, creamy head. Mouthfeel is a little light. This is very akin to Guinness, only with a more fruity sweetness.UPDATED: MAY 18, 2004 This beer poured a deep black with typical nitro head.  Aroma is very similar to guiness in that it was weak and sweet, but this differed by faintly hinting at a smoke aroma.  Flavor is fairly decent, yet entirely to weak.  Picking up decent malts that almost taste like cookies, a bit of a roast coffee flavor, and smoke, but most of all, water.  Good and easy drinking, I suppose, but for the price I could have gotten four bottles of something much better.nitrocan, poured a dark brown with a thick dark tan head.  aroma is mostly roast malt, has some dirt and cream.  taste is pretty basic, almost like a cup of light coffee with too much cream in it (it tastes watered down).  but i love the mouthfeel on these nitro cans.  smooth, creamy, a little thick.  overall not a bad brew but it didnt blow me away.  a bit overpriced, but a good session beer.Dark black color, medium creamy head. Roasted malts, slightly sweet. Slight hoppyness. A lighter bodied stout. Good flavor. Mouthfeel is a little thin. Finish is clean. Aftertaste is slightly bitter, roasted malts.Pours almost black with a two finger thick, tightly bubbled cream colored head. Nose is faint  with coffee, roasted malt and light chocolate. The flavor is a bit more full with the same influences. Decent medium full mouthfeel with a subtly bitter finish.Draught. Black with a tan head. Light body, roasted coffee malt flavour. Sweetish aftertaste. Thinish.sampled from a can.  Standard nitro pour.  Dark brown/almost black in color.  Aroma is light roast and chocolate, perhaps some chalk.  Taste is lighty roasty and chocolately, pretty light bodied.  ok.Diabolical. Creamy head? Try creamy fucking pint. I\\'ve had less cream out of a carton of cream. No real beer flavour to it, although the extreme blackness observed when this shit in a can finally settles is quite nice. Everything else about this beer is a big horses arse.Nice and foamy with a milkshake-like head. Initially sweet, quickly turns to sharp and sour. Slight black licorice flavor. Thin and sort of watery (when comparing to many other stouts). Fairly enjoyable, but no Shakespeare or Guinness, by any means.16 oz can.  Poured an opaque black color with a two finger, creamy tan head.  The aroma was roasted malt and a hint of coffee.  The flavor was coffee, nuts and roasted malt.  This was enjoyable.Thick creamy head thanks to the widget. Good bitterness with a nice burnt malt taste. Smooth.Draft. Pretty black color. Taste is a bit roasted and caramel dominated but mouthfeel is a bit to watery I think,still a decent brew.'"
